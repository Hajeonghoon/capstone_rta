Operation of vehicles in AGV system and method for analyzing the operation	2009	IEEJ Transactions on Industry Applications	It is important to discuss the behavior of traffic at merging sections for the design and realization of an automated guided vehicle system (AGVS). In this study, we deal with a merging section of the AGVS by considering a time limit for the merging of vehicles. Near the merging section, traffic flowing in one direction must form a queue to avoid collisions between vehicles. We propose an improvement in the control strategy proposed in the previous research. However it is difficult to analyze the mathematical model of the merging section. Analysis can be performed only for the case in which the time limit is one unit. We also propose a method for analyzing the model for an arbitrary time limit using a linear recurrence relation. We quantitatively discuss the influence of the time limit on the average queue length and the detour rate.  2009 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

Possible improvement of the operation of vehicles driven by omnidirectional wheels	2009	ISCIII '09 - 4th International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Intelligent Informatics, Proceedings	Special Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGVs) equipped with at least three omnidirectional wheels may be very useful tools in industrial applications because-in contrast to the Ackerman engines-their position and orientation with respect to the plane of operation can simultaneously be prescribed. So they have the ability for smart and precise navigation in a crowded environment. In the present constructions each wheel can move in arbitrary direction but cannot exert contact force in arbitrary direction in the plane since normally only the big wheels have driving system. The small ones can roll like the wheels of the roller-skates. It will be shown via numerical simulations that this solution requires considerable power consumption since in the turning/rotating phase of the motion the wheels have to work "against each other". To improve this situation a simple solution is outlined that could make it possible to realize coordinated driving of the small wheels, too. Via simulations it is pointed out that simultaneous driving of the big and small wheels could considerably reduce the power consumption of such devices that is a significant factor if the vehicles have to carry their power sources of limited capacity, too. In the simulations the effects of imprecise model parameters are compensated by simple adaptive fixed point transformations developed at Budapest Tech.  2009 IEEE.

An MILP for scheduling problems in an FMS with one vehicle	2009	European Journal of Operational Research	This paper concerns the mathematical formulation and optimal solutions for the Flexible Manufacturing Systems Scheduling Problem (FMSSP) with one vehicle. This linear formulation differs from the previously published ones as it takes into account the maximum number of jobs allowed in the system, limited input/output buffer capacities, empty vehicle trips and no-move-ahead trips simultaneously. Our objective is to propose optimal solutions for small and medium-sized instances and to examine a number of commonly used assumptions and heuristics. Computational experiments are carried out on instances adapted from Bilge and Ulusoy [Bilge, Ãœ., Ulusoy, G., 1995. A time window approach to simultaneous scheduling of machines and material handling system in an FMS. Operations Research 43, 1058-1070] and the following heuristics are evaluated: FIFO (First In First Out) rules for input/output buffer management; and FIFO, SPT (Shortest Processing Time), STT (Shortest Travel Time) and MOQS (Maximum Outgoing Queue Size) rules concerning the vehicle. The consequences of classical assumptions are also studied: ignoring empty trips, ignoring no-move-ahead constraints, and ignoring vehicle-disjunction constraints. The numerical experiments provide a set of optimal solutions and allow to evaluate the performances of heuristic search schemes.  2008.

On-line reference trajectory generation for manually convoying a platoon of automatic urban vehicles	2009	2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, IROS 2009	Various "Urban Transportation Systems" are currently in developing, in order to put forward solutions to congestion and pollution in dense areas. Autonomous electric vehicles in free-access can be seen as an attractive approach, in view of the large flexibility that can be expected. One instrumental functionality linked to this solution is platoon motion: several autonomous vehicles accurately follow the trajectory of a manually driven first vehicle, with pre-specified inter-distances. A global decentralized platoon control strategy, supported by inter-vehicle communications and relying on nonlinear control techniques is here proposed. Each vehicle is controlled with respect to the same smooth reference trajectory, inferred on-line from the motion of the first vehicle via B-spline optimization. Experimental results, carried out with four urban vehicles, demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach.  2009 IEEE.

Modeling strategy by adaptive genetic algorithm for production reactive scheduling with simultaneous use of machines and AGVs	2009	Conference Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	The problem of production scheduling of manufacturing systems is characterized by the large number of possible solutions. Several researches have been using the Genetic Algorithms (GA) as a search method to solve this problem since these algorithms have the capacity of globally exploring the search space and find good solutions quickly. Since the performance of the GA is directly related to the choice of the parameters of genetic operators, and a bad choice can depreciate the performance, this paper proposes the use of Adaptive Genetic Algorithm to solve this kind of scheduling problem considering the machines and the Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs). The aim of this paper is to get a good production reactive schedule in order to achieve a good makespan value in a low response obtaining time. The results of this paper were validated in large scenarios and compared with the results of two other approaches. These results are presented and discussed in this paper. 2009 IEEE.

Idle vehicle circulation policies in a semiconductor FAB	2009	Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing	Idle vehicle handling is addressed for the path-based automated material handling system (AMHS) in a semiconductor fabrication line. Since a typical semiconductor fabrication line has a single path in each bay and no sidetracks to park idle vehicles, a vehicle should be dispatched to somewhere if necessary even without a new assignment to prevent blocking of other vehicles. We investigate the continuous-move policy, the move-when-necessary policy and their variants. Our simulations show that the idle vehicle circulation policy significantly affects the AMHS productivity, so the policy should be carefully designed for the AMHS instance.  2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Petri net-based control of the material handling flow path for automated guided vehicles	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation, ICMA 2009	Because of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) routing flexibility, they have been used in many manufacturing systems, especially those in which parts with diverse and complex processing routes are made. This paper introduces the design of an material handling flow path control system in a partitioned zone through the timed Petri Nets. The initial requirements of a system specified with sequence diagrams are translated into a single timed Petri net model representing the route behavior of the system. Refer to the specifically part scheduling route for processing, setup a extended material flow matrix, then establish the corresponding timed Petri Net graphs to control a vehicle guide path tracks and location of the pickup (P) and dropoff (D) stations. The flowchart of control system design has its general-purpose modes considering all kind of circular routes with the dwell places, allowing easy adaptations to features corresponding to specific applications is highly desirable. 2009 IEEE.

Vehicle production with Wireless control	2009	AutoTechnology	Wireless local area network (LAN) has proved to be an effective wireless solution as it ensures potential increase in production flexibility while maintaining the cost in the automotive industry. It is recommended to proceed in a systematic and structured way from planning to commissioning thereby ensuring reliable operation of an Industrial Wireless LAN. The choice of the antenna plays an important role for the efficient functioning of WLAN such as omnidirectional antennas that transmit through 360Â° on the horizontal, directional antennas, which amplify signals in the direction of a specific opening angle and leaky wave conductors (RCoax antennas). Omnidirectional antennas are used to cover the larger areas in which automated guided vehicle (AGV) systems or personnel with portable HMI devices are moving. Directional antennas are used for the lanes of a high-bay warehouse in which the transport systems move primarily along a straight longitudinal axis and RCoax leaky wave conductor is used for the winding routes of an overhead monorail conveyor.

An autonomous robotic system for load transportation	2009	ETFA 2009 - 2009 IEEE Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation	This paper presents an overview of an autonomous robotic system for material handling. The system is being developed by extending the functionalities of traditional AGVs to be able to operate reliably and safely in highly dynamic environments. Traditionally, the reliable functioning of AGVs relies on the availability of adequate infrastructure to support navigation. In the target environments of our system, such infrastructure is difficult to setup in an efficient way. Additionally, the location of objects to handle are unknown, which requires runtime object detection and tracking. Another requirement to be fulfilled by the system is the ability to generate trajectories dynamically, which is uncommon in industrial AGV systems. 2009 IEEE.

Carrier phase differential GPS based navigation system for automated ground vehicles	2009	60th International Astronautical Congress 2009, IAC 2009	Recently the Global Positioning System (GPS) technologies have made innovations in the guidance area of small mobile robots. Precisely controllable Autonomous Ground Vehicles (AGVs) can support a variety of highly-detailed missions that are operated in unsafe or so difficult environments, such as removal of hazardous chemical, explosive, or radioactive waste. AGVs offer many potential advantages over human control. However unsuccessful operations have happened due to positioning sensor limitations. With the recent development of Carrier Phase Differential GPS(CDGPS) technology a single inexpensive GPS receiver can measure a position of a vehicle's position to within a few centimeter errors. In this paper a Global Navigation Satellite System(GNSS)-based AGV system was designed, and tested on using a golf cart. A simplified vehicle model and a guidance algorithm are employed for a GNSS-based AGVs system. The proposed strategy has been successfully tested in a large field which is associated with three trajectories (straight, circle, curve). Test result of golf cart position error is 0.3m in comparison with reference trajectories.

Study on AGV posture estimating based on distributed Kalman fusion for multi-sensor	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics, ROBIO 2009	AGV is one of important conveying tools in advanced manufacturing system. In order to convey material to the destination safely, exactly and real-timely, the controlling system of AGV must have some functions such as perceiving the surrounding, planning the path, positioning and controlling. Positioning is the key function for AGV to convey the material real-timely and accurately. In this paper, the novel Distributed Kalman Filter based on multi-sensor was designed for XAUTâ€¢AGV100 investigated. AGV's attitude angle was estimated by fusing the metrical information from sensors such as encoders, gyro and ultrasonic sensors. It was indicated by the simulation that the designed filter is reliable and effective. It is tested by the experiment of AGV tracking a linear-path that the filter can estimate AGV's attitude angle accurately and timely while AGV is moving. The positioning accuracy of the filter can meet the need of positioning AGV in manufacturing system through theory analysis and experiment.  2009 IEEE.

Investigations on benefits generated by using fuzzy numbers in a TOPSIS model developed for automated guided vehicle selection problem	2009	Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)	Selection of the appropriate automated guided vehicle (AGV) for a manufacturing company is a very important but at the same time a complex problem because of the availability of wide-ranging alternatives and similarities among AGVs. Although, the available studies in the literature developed various fuzzy models, they do not propose any approaches to measure the benefits generated by incorporating fuzziness in their selection models. This paper aims to fill this gap by trying to quantify the level of benefit provided by employing the fuzzy numbers in the multi attribute decision making (MADM) models. Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is used as the MADM approach to rank the AGV in this paper. In the paper, by increasing the fuzziness level steadily in the fuzzy numbers, the obtained AGV rankings are compared with the ranking obtained with the crisp values. The statistical significance of the differences between the ranks is calculated using Spearman's rank-correlation coefficient. It can be observed from the results that as the vagueness and imprecision increases, fuzzy numbers instead of crisp numbers should be used. On the other hand, in situations where there is a low level of fuzziness or the average value of the fuzzy number can be guessed, using crisp numbers will be more than adequate.  2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Automatic guided vehicle control by vision system	2009	IEEM 2009 - IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management	AGV's control has been developed in several types. This research aims to develop the AGV's control using image processing in order to assist AGV from losing the way when the guide line is missing. The AGV, used for experiment, has three wheels. There are one wheel at the front and another two rear wheels. The front wheel is driving and steering controlled by using DC motors on each axis. An encoder is attached on steering axis which is used to check AGV orientation angle. At two rear wheels, there are also attached encoder which is used to measuring the position of AGV for controlling distance of the AGV motion. PLC is applied for AGV's control application. Wireless color CCD camera is used to be a sensor for detection line's color that is placed on the ground which is the front side of AGV. CCD sensor is applied to navigate the detected path of traveling. Red line is constructed for AGV's path. Image processing is operated for detecting the different of guide line and background. Laplacian operator method is applied for edge detection algorithm including filter and thresholding technique. Computer program will created the virtual line by using trigonometry method and sent current position data to AGV's motion controller. 2009 IEEE.

The simulation design and analysis of a flexible manufacturing system with automated guided vehicle system	2009	Journal of Manufacturing Systems	This paper presents the simulation design and analysis of a Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) with an Automated Guided Vehicle system (AGVs). To maximize the operating performance of FMS with AGVs, many parameters must be considered, including the number, velocity, and dispatching rule of AGV, part-types, scheduling, and buffer sizes. Of the various critical factors, we consider the following three: (1) minimizing the congestion; (2) minimizing the vehicle utilization; and (3) maximizing the throughput. In this paper, we consider the systematic analysis methods that combine a simulation-based analytic and optimization technique that is Multi-Objective Non-Linear Programming (MONLP) and Evolution Strategy (ES). MONLP determines the design parameters of the system through multi-factorial and regression analyses. ES is used to verify each parameter for simulation-based optimization. A validation test for the two methods is conducted. This method-based approach towards design yields the correct experimental results, ensures confidence in the specification of design parameters and supports a robust framework for analysis.  2010 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

Stochastic elements in transportation system simulation - Unnecessary?	2009	IFAC Proceedings Volumes (IFAC-PapersOnline)	Discrete event system simulation is often seen as a genuine tool to investigate the performance of transportation systems. The complexity of real-world systems often prevents us from accurately describing these by a mathematical model that can be evaluated analytically, thus, simulation is often the only realistic alternative. Another advantage of the simulation is the ability to include statistical analysis for different simulation scenarios. Well-known approaches of incorporating uncertainty into models include trace driven simulations and sampling directly from gathered data. Another aspect to be taken into account is the economics of simulation modelling; a more detailed model requires additional building time, and proper treatment of stochastic models requires statistical analysis, which again usually implies several simulation runs. From this outset the following question arises: Should stochastic behaviour be included in transportation simulation models in the first place? We present real case examples including evaluation of the internal logistics of a beverage manufacturer, capacity analysis of an automatic guided vehicle system, cost benefit analysis (CBA) of a railway network investment and evaluation of different multipurpose railway wagons, where stochastic behaviour is dealt with in different ways. Based on the cases we make an initial attempt to formulate framework for deciding how to include stochastic behaviour in the simulation model. For further research topics we suggest formulating explicit guidelines to deal with stochastics to increase the efficiency of model building.  2009 IFAC.

Robust type-2 fuzzy control of an automatic guided vehicle for wall-following	2009	SoCPaR 2009 - Soft Computing and Pattern Recognition	Unexpected conditions are often encountered by practitioners in the navigation of autonomous guided vehicles (AGV). In dynamic circumstances, traditional fuzzy controller using simple type-1 fuzzy sets may not be robust enough to overcome uncertainties caused by noise-corrupted sonar signals. For this reason, an interval type-2 fuzzy wall-following controller (IT2FWFC) is developed to improve the resilience to inaccuracies that can hinder the normal operation of an AGV. The antecedent part of the proposed IT2FWFC is made up of type-2 fuzzy sets and its consequent part is formed from fuzzy singletons. Furthermore, the non-sensitiveness property of the IT2FWFC for noise-elimination is also analyzed in this paper. In order to reduce computational loads during practical control, a simplified center-of-sets (COS) type-reduction procedure with clearly marked rule indices is also developed. Experiment results are included to illustrate the robustness of an AGV when detecting objects with uneven surfaces and exhibiting its wall-following behavior at the same time. The wall-following behavior of the IT2FWFC outperforms that of the type-1 fuzzy wall-following controller (T1FWFC) designed previously by the same framework of this paper.  2009 IEEE.

Control methodology of transfer crane with look-ahead rule in harbor transportation system	2009	Distributed Autonomous Robotic Systems 8	Currently, container ships move cargo with minimal participation from inland chassis trucks. However, there is slack time between the departure of container ships and the completion of cargo handling of container ships without the participation of inland chassis trucks; therefore, inland chassis trucks can be used to move cargo without delaying the departure time. In this paper, we propose a solution involving the control algorithms of transfer cranes (TC). The TCs work according to the heuristic rules with look-ahead to forecast the arrival times of yard and inland chassis trucks. Simulation results show that the waiting time of inland chassis trucks can be reduced to meet the departure times of container ships.

Motion control of the soccer robot based on fuzzy logic	2009	AIP Conference Proceedings	Robot soccer is a challenging platform for multi-agent research, involving topics such as real-time image processing and control, robot path planning, obstacle avoidance and machine learning. The conventional robot control consists of methods for path generation and path following. When a robot moves away the estimated path, it must return immediately, and while doing so, the obstacle avoidance behavior and the effectiveness of such a path are not guaranteed. So, motion control is a difficult task, especially in real time and high speed control. This paper describes the use of fuzzy logic control for the low level motion of a soccer robot. Firstly, the modelling of the soccer robot is presented. The soccer robot based on MiroSoT Small Size league is a differential-drive mobile robot with non-slipping and pure-rolling.

Simple adaptive dynamical control of vehicles driven by omnidirectional wheels	2009	ICCC 2009 - IEEE 7th International Conference on Computational Cybernetics	Precise control of Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGVs) navigating between the aisles of manufacturing systems by the use of local markers is an important task. On the basis of the geometric model of the workspace and the vehicles and that of the sensor uncertainties precise trajectories were recently generated along which the vehicle safely can move. In order to achieve precise trajectory tracking the effects of the system's dynamical uncertainties (modeling errors and possible external perturbations) have to be compensated. In the present paper a simple, Fixed point transformations based adaptive control is proposed for this purpose. The proposed method is tested via simulation for a vehicle of triangular shape, driven by three omnidirectional wheels. The method is also able to monitor and evade the conditions that may lead to turning over the vehicle. 2009IEEE.

Moving robots' mind of autonomous decentralized FMS and mind change control	2009	Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Artificial Life and Robotics, AROB 14th'09	This paper describes the control of the moving robots in an autonomous decentralized FMS by moving robots' mind change. In Autonomous Decentralized Flexible Manufacturing System where a lot of moving robots operate, there are problems of path interference. There is an existing method we have developed, called AAA used to evade from these interference problems. However, using this method, it is very difficult to grasp entirely the innumerable path interference situations that really occur. Therefore, to evade these unexpected situations flexibly, we propose the mind model which is the complicated expression of combinations from the three elements: Stimulation Vector, Unit and Load. Even if a same situation happens, moving robots take different actions when the mind is changed. ISAROB 2009.

Fast and seamless handover for secure mobile industrial applications with 802.11r	2009	Proceedings - Conference on Local Computer Networks, LCN	Concerning its temporal behavior the latency caused by a handover from one access point (AP) to another is of particular interest for mobile industrial applications, e.g. automated guided vehicles, due to their real-time requirements in the range of a few milliseconds. With the advancements of wireless local area networks, fast roaming support has become one of the most important issues in IEEE 802.11. The IEEE 802.11r standard amendment has been specified to address roaming capabilities of real-time applications with an attempt to minimize BSS transition time while still providing the 802.11i security and 802.11e QoS. 802.11r permits seamless connectivity with a fast and secure handover from one AP to another within the same mobility domain. It provides an opportunity to derive encryption keys prior to a reassociation to reduce the connectivity loss during the handover. It also provides features for resource reservation and central mobility management. This paper presents an implementation of 802.11r based on a Linux operating system. It uses a softMAC approach that allows moving the processing of MAC layer management entity (MLME) from kernelspace to userspace. Measurement results show the performance gain of 802.11r as compared to a legacy implementation in terms of a handover time reduction, which is a core requirement of wireless industrial networks. 2009 IEEE.

A global decentralized platoon control strategy, supported by inter-vehicle communications and relying on nonlinear control techniques is here proposed. In the nominal case, each vehicle is controlled with respect to the same smooth reference trajectory modelled by cubic B-Splines. This trajectory is locally modified and relayed on-line when a vehicle detects an obstacle. The trajectory distortion naturally reflects a driver's behaviour, since it consists in approximated clothoidal trajectories and the use of B-Splines ensures consistent connections. Experimental results, carried out with several urban vehicles, demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach. 2009 IEEE.

Vehicle detection and recognition for automated guided vehicle	2009	ICCAS-SICE 2009 - ICROS-SICE International Joint Conference 2009, Proceedings	In this paper, we present a two-stage vision-based approach to detect front and rear vehicle views in road scene images using eigenspace and a support vector machine for classification. The first stage is hypothesis generation (HG), in which potential vehicles are hypothesized. During the hypothesis generation step, we use a vertical, horizontal edge map to create potential regions where vehicles may be present. The second stage is hypothesis verification (HV). In this stage, all hypotheses are verified by using a Principle Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification, which is robust for both front and rear vehicle view detection problems. Our methods have been tested on different real road images and show very good performance.  2009 SICE.

Planning block widths for storage yards of container terminals with parallel blocks	2009	IEEM 2009 - IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management	Container terminals have different layout structures depending on the equipment used and the orientation of their storage blocks. In this paper we discuss the influence of different block widths on the yard performance for a terminal with parallel blocks. Different trade-offs are described that have to be taken into consideration when planning the block width of a container terminal yard. Formulas are derived to estimate expected travel times for trucks and yard cranes for different possible block widths. For an exemplary scenario numerical results are presented. The results for the exemplary scenario show that an optimal block width regarding the yard performance has eight rows. 2009 IEEE.

Modeling and optimal control of automated trolleys	2009	Conference Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	Automated trolleys have been developed to meet the needs of material handling in industries. The velocity of automated trolleys is regulated by an S-shaped (or trapezoid-shaped) acceleration and deceleration profile. In consequence of the velocity profile, the control system of automated trolleys is nonlinear and open-looped. In order to linearize the control system, we use a second order dynamic element to replace the acceleration and declaration curve in practice, and design an optimal controller under the quadratic cost function. Performance of the proposed approach is also compared to the conventional method. The simulation shows a better dynamic performance of the developed control system. 2009 IEEE.

An agent-based approach for scheduling under consideration of the influencing factors in FMS	2009	IECON Proceedings (Industrial Electronics Conference)	Production scheduling classically regards the processing units as the only constraining factor. However, scheduling for flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) involves a set of other allocation decisions like allocating jobs to transportation units. Ignoring the relevant allocation decisions has led to widening the gap between theory and practice. In this paper, an agent-based approach for a comprehensive scheduling for FMS is presented. This approach allows for generating a production schedule under consideration of the affecting resources. This is made possible by representing resources as agents. The generation of a schedule results from the goal-oriented interaction among the concerned agents. Based on the illustration of application scenarios, it is shown that this approach results in enhancing the overall performance. 2009 IEEE.

Maintenance of robot's equilibrium in a noisy environment with fuzzy controller	2009	Proceedings - 2009 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Intelligent Systems, ICIS 2009	Tasks that involve controlling complex systems have been less prevalent due to the lack of analytical methods that can adequately handle uncertainty and concisely represent knowledge in practical control systems. Recent research and application employing non-analytical methods of computing such as fuzzy logic, evolutionary computation, and neural networks have demonstrated the utility and potential of these paradigms for intelligent control of complex systems. In this paper we present a fuzzy logic controller for a mobile robot which can handle external forces and maintain robot's equilibrium in a noisy environment. These forces with different angles and magnitudes deviate the robot from its path, but the fuzzy logic controller handle them properly and place the mobile robot in the right path to destination. Based on its design simplicity, its ease of implementation, and its robustness properties, a fuzzy logic controller is used in this paper to control robot's equilibrium. 2009 IEEE.

Accurate positioning using short-range communications	2009	2009 International Conference on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Workshops	Satellite-based positioning systems such as GPS have been used for positioning by the transportation industry for decades. Accurate positioning (<1 cm error) requires the availability of multiple (5+) GPS signals which is 'possible' only in suburban communities but utterly unachievable in urban areas. We are motivated by the inevitably and imperative need to resolve accurate positioning issues for transportation and industrial applications. In this research we focus on developing positioning scheme based on short-range wireless signals. To achieve that, we develop a system assuming the availability of multiple fixed access points (5+) and employ Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDoA) with Kalman Filter. We also discuss multi/tri-lateration and evaluate some of the root causes for Dilution of Precision (DoP) of calculated positioning. We use fixed calibrated 2.4 GHz access points. We use realtime observed data while applying our model off-line. We extended the model to mimic the 5.9 GHz Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) signals as defined in IEEE 1609.x. Results are compared in each case and compared to accurately calibrated Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) record captured on the same testing. We maintained clear Line-of-Sight (LoS) throughout our evaluation and used low speed of the moving vehicles (< 60 Km/h). 2009 IEEE.

Visibility line based methods for UAV path planning	2009	ICCAS-SICE 2009 - ICROS-SICE International Joint Conference 2009, Proceedings	This paper addresses path planning algorithms for an Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based on Visibility Lines (VL) method for real time applications. VL has been chosen because it provides a solution with optimal path length i.e. minimal distance travelled from starting point to target point. However, as known, the main problem with VL is that the computational burdensome grows exponentially as the number of obstacles increases; hence, the VL method cannot be applied in real-time applications especially when a large number of obstacles are present. To overcome such problems, we have developed algorithms based on VL called Base Line-Oriented Visibility Line (BLOVL) and its associate, Core Algorithm (CA) in which only the obstacles that intersect with the base line and their extensions are considered. As these algorithms calculate the path relatively fast, they are capable to plan UAV's new path to avoid pop-up obstacles with minimal length and reach safely at the target point. Through simulations, BLOVL & CA algorithms have been proven to produce better results over the original VL method in term of processing time with optimal solution. Since both algorithms allow planning and re-planning executed faster, they are applicable for real-time applications in dynamic environments.  2009 SICE.

A simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm for field robots based on laser range sensor and stereo vision	2009	American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers Annual International Meeting 2009, ASABE 2009	An improved simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm for a field robot is proposed in this paper. The algorithm enables the field robot to efficiently build a 2D and 3D graphic model of its environment based on the data acquired by a laser range sensor and a stereo vision camera module. Since reliable localization is an essential component of any autonomous vehicle, this research focused on the development of the methodology and experimentation of the SLAM algorithm that may be utilized in either indoor or outdoor environments. The sensor fusion design aspect and robot localization method are also presented in relation to the desired accuracy and possible agricultural applications such as greenhouse management and autonomous navigation in an open field. We emphasized in the derivation of the kinematic model of the field robot, particle filter, and path planning to enhance the performance of the SLAM algorithm and autonomous navigation. The experimental results have shown that the developed SLAM algorithm can deliver good accuracy in accordance with the initial uncertainty of the field robot. Based on the reconstructed map and the localization method, the developed field robot was able to navigate in an agricultural environment with desirable accuracy. Analyses of absolute and relative errors of field robot localization are discussed. It was also demonstrated that the developed SLAM algorithm successfully constructed and maintained maps for long runs. 096395.

Automatic guidance system for trolley-powered mining haul trucks	2009	Conference Record - IAS Annual Meeting (IEEE Industry Applications Society)	The work presented in this paper is useful to any application involving a trolley-powered vehicle; however, it is of interest, in particular, to trolley-powered haul trucks operated at open pit mining sites. The paper presents a designed and developed prototype for an automatic guidance system for an overhead electric-powered truck. The main purpose of the automatic guidance system is to maintain the truck inline under the overhead power lines, allowing it to achieve higher speeds on grade. In an open pit mine with a trolley operation, this would be an added feature to the direct trolley and diesel boost application. The automatic guidance system would assist or completely relieve the driver when the truck is running on trolley, and hence, full utilization of the overhead trolley system would be achieved. The microcontroller-based guidance system measures simple quantities directly from the overhead power lines, and sends commands to guide the vehicle without the need for tracks or buried wires. The system is tested and validated on a model truck powered by overhead lines, which is designed and built to emulate the real haul truck of mining sites.  2009 IEEE.

Transporter scheduling based on a network flow model under a dynamic blocktransportation environment	2009	2009 International Conference on Computers and Industrial Engineering, CIE 2009	This paper considers a transporter scheduling problem under dynamic blocktransportation environment in shipbuilding. In dynamic situations, there existthe addition, cancellation or change of block transportation requirements,sudden breakdowns, and maintenance of transporters. Some blocks are available tobe picked up at a specific time during the planning horizon while some otherblocks need to be delivered before a specific time. These requirements cause twopenalty times: 1) delay times incurred when a block is picked up after arequired start time, and 2) tardy times incurred when a block shipment iscompleted after a required delivery time. The blocks are located at differentareas in the shipyard and transported by transporters. The objective of thispaper is to propose a heuristic algorithm based on a network flow model whichminimize the weighted sum of empty transporter travel times, delay times, andtardy times. Also, a rolling scheduling algorithm is proposed for dynamic blocktransportation environment. The performance of the proposed heuristic algorithmsare evaluated through a simulation experiment.  2009 IEEE.

Web-based production management and control in a distributed manufacturing environment	2009	Collaborative Design and Planning for Digital Manufacturing	This chapter presents a methodology for web-based manufacturing management and control. The methodology is a part of a WebMachining system, which is based on the e-manufacturing concept. The WebMachining virtual company encompasses three distributed manufacturing systems, all of them located in different cities in Brazil, i.e. a flexible manufacturing cell (FMC) at GRACO/UnB (BrasÃ­lia), a flexible manufacturing system (FMS) at SOCIESC (Joinville), and a lathe at UFSC (Florianopolis). The methodology includes planning, scheduling, control, and remote manufacturing of components. A user (customer) uses the manufacturing services provided by the WebMachining virtual company through the Internet, in order to execute operations and processes to design and manufacture the components. The proposed methodology integrates engineering and manufacturing management through an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software that previews which of the three systems will produce the ordered component, and this decision is based on parameters related to each of the three systems. After the decision, the ERP system will generate the production schedule. Also in this work, the implementation aspects of a web-based shop floor controller for the FMC at GRACO/UnB are presented. The FMC consists of a Romi Galaxy 15M turning centre, an ASEA IRB6 robot manipulator, a Mitutoyo LSM-6100 laser micrometer, an automated guided vehicle (AGV), and a pallet to store the blank and finished components. The functional model, which depicts the modules and their relationships in the web-based shop floor controller, serves as a basic model to implement the real system. After that, the proposed implementation architecture based on the object-oriented technology is presented.  2009 Springer London.	Book	b	ch	Chapter	Brazil	1	Engineering (all)	None
Simulation-based personnel planning for materials handling at a cross-docking center under retail distribution environment	2009	Proceedings - Winter Simulation Conference	This study focuses on the personnel planning of materials handling at a real cross-docking center under a retail distribution environment. Materials handling at a cross-docking center is complicated and labour intensive. Managers are usually under enormous pressure to optimize personnel planning to deal with an increasing variety of items handled by different processes. In this study, a flexible and stepwise procedure of personnel planning is proposed to minimize the total personnel expenses at a cross-docking center, especially taking merchandise mixing and operator skills into consideration. The procedure includes adopting simulation together with integer programming. In addition, the procedure is applied to an actual cross-docking center in order to confirm its effectiveness.

Integrated operational techniques for efficient robotic batch manufacturing systems	2009	2009 IEEE International Symposium on Assembly and Manufacturing, ISAM 2009	This paper focuses on a batch manufacturing system with multiple industrial robots. In this system, material-handling robots (MHRs) and material-processing robots (MPRs) are operating. Inappropriate operations of these robots might cause a bottleneck. In addition, a bottleneck is a constraint that dominates the entire system performance, that is, the productivity. Therefore, for an efficient system, these robots have to operate appropriately while relating to each other. This is a challenge in this study. We propose the following operational techniques: route planning approaches for the MHR and operation dispatching rules for the MPR on the basis of task-assignment to the robots that will reduce the effect of a bottleneck. Furthermore, reactive cooperation among the MPRs, so that the robots respond to a fluctuating heavy workload caused by the shifting bottleneck, is an essential operational technique. Throughout the simulation experiments, each combination of the operational techniques is examined; finally, the integrated operational techniques are shown. 2009 IEEE.

Experimental verification of dynamic petri recurrent-fuzzy-neural-network path tracking control design for mobile robot	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation, ICCA 2009	This study focuses on the design of a dynamic Petri recurrent-fuzzy-neural- network (DPRFNN), and this network structure is applied to the path tracking control of a nonholonomic mobile robot for verifying its validity. In the DPRFNN, the concept of a Petri net (PN) with dynamic threshold value and the recurrent frame of internal feedback loops are incorporated into a traditional fuzzy neural network (FNN) to alleviate the computation burden of parameter learning and to enhance the dynamic mapping of network ability. Moreover, the supervised gradient descent method is used to develop the online training algorithm for the DPRFNN control. In order to guarantee the convergence of path tracking errors, analytical methods based on a discrete-type Lyapunov function are proposed to determine varied learning rates for DPRFNN. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed DPRFNN control scheme under different moving paths is verified by experimental results, and its superiority is indicated in comparison with FNN, recurrent FNN (RFNN), Petri FNN (PFNN) and Petri RFNN (PRFNN) control systems. 2009 IEEE.

Robotic pose estimation via an adaptive Kalman filter using state-varying noise	2009	Proceedings of the IASTED International Conference on Robotics and Applications	Swarm robotics offers the promise of enhanced performance and robustness relative to that of individual robots, with decreased cost or time-to-completion for certain tasks.

Applying multi-agents technologies in industrial plants	2009	2009 16th International Conference on Systems, Signals and Image Processing, IWSSIP 2009	The manufacturing industries are now experiencing fierce pressure of competition. The advancement in computer networks and information technologies has been gradually reshaping the manufacturing companies by shifting from the industrial age to the information era. A number of new manufacturing and management strategies have emerged for the innovation of manufacturing enterprises. Process and workflow planning and scheduling are considered as two separate and distinct phases in manufacturing. Traditional approaches to these problems do not consider the constraints of both domains simultaneously and can only result in sub-optimal solutions. This separation becomes a barrier to further improving manufacturing performance.

Auction-based heuristic in digitised manufacturing environment for part type selection and operation allocation	2009	Collaborative Design and Planning for Digital Manufacturing	This chapter high lights some of the key issues involved in developing real schedule generation architecture in an e-manufacturing environment. The high cost, long cycle time of development of shop floor control systems and the lack of robust system integration capabilities are some of the major deterrents to the development of the underlying architecture. We conceptualise a robust framework, capable of providing flexibility to the system, communicating among various entities and making intelligent decisions. Owing to the fast communication, distributed control and autonomous character, agent-oriented architecture has been preferred to address the scheduling problem in e-manufacturing. An integer programming-based model with dual objectives of minimising the make span and increasing the system throughput has been formulated to determine the optimal part type sequence from the part type pool. It is very difficult to appraise all possible combinations of operationmachine allocations in order to accomplish the above objectives. A combinatorial auctionbased heuristic has been proposed to minimise large search spaces and to obtain optimal or near optimal solutions of operation-machine allocations of given part types with tool slots and available machine time as constraint. The effects of exceeding the planning horizon due to urgency of part types or over time given to complete the part type processing on shop floor is also exhibited and a significant increase in system throughput is observed.  2009 Springer London.

Simultaneous dynamic scheduling and collision-free path planning for multiple autonomous vehicles	2009	2009 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation, ICIA 2009	When autonomous vehicles are deployed to perform transportation tasks within a confined space and strict time constraint, the problem of optimizing the assignment of tasks to vehicles is complicated by the need to ensure safety (they do not collide with or impede each other) and maximize the efficiency and productivity. With the increasing number of autonomous vehicles in practical settings, the ability to schedule tasks in a manner that inherently considers the effects of task allocations on space contention (which in turn compromises efficiency) is important to performance improvement. The main contribution of this paper is an approach to simultaneously conduct dynamic task allocation and collision-free path planning in an environment where multiple autonomous vehicles operate on a network of paths and where each path segment can only be occupied by one vehicle at a given instant. In particular, a generic algorithm for effective task allocation is investigated and applied in conjunction with an application-specific objective function. The proposed approach is able to solve the dynamic scheduling, planning and collision avoidance problem in an integrated way such that the overall productivity of the transportation system is improved. Simulation results based on a real-world industrial material handling environment demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.  2009 IEEE.

A multi-agent controller on embedded system for complex mechatronics	2009	2009 Chinese Control and Decision Conference, CCDC 2009	A multi-agent controller on embedded system is presented for complex mechatronics in this paper. The agents' concept is combined with a physical control system to produce a controller agent. The multi-controller system of complex mechatronics can be regarded as a series of controller agents, and they can be converted to the Multi-Agent System (MAS) easily by changing corresponding concepts. Controller agents can be implemented by a number of agent tasks located on different microprocessors at the hardware level and coordinated by a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) at the software level. In the view of control agents and MAS, an embedded control system with ARM and DSP is designed and developed for a vision-based Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV), from the agents' partitions to the MAS design, and from the hardware construction to the software programming.

GPS and sonar based area mapping and navigation by mobile robots	2009	IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN)	In this paper, we have presented a GPS and sonar based area mapping and navigation scheme for a mobile robot. A mapping is achieved between the GPS space and the world coordinates of the mobile robot which enables us to generate direct motion commands for it. This mapping enables the robot to navigate among different GPS locations within the mapped area. The GPS data is extracted online to get the latitude and longitude information of a particular location. In the training phase, a 2-D axis transformation is used to relate local robot frame with the robot world coordinates and then the actual world coordinates are mapped from the GPS data using a RBFN (radial basis function network) based Neural Network. In the second phase, direct GPS data is used to get the mapping into the world coordinates of mobile robot using the trained network and the motion commands are generated accordingly. The physical placement of sonar devices, their ranging limits and beam opening angles are considered during navigation for possible collision detection and obstacle avoidance. This scheme is successfully implemented in real time with Pioneer mobile robot from ActivMedia Robotics and GPS receiver. The scheme is also tested in the simulation to justify its application in the real world.  2009 IEEE.

Plan repair in conflict-free routing	2009	Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)	In conflict-free routing a set of agents have to traverse a common infrastructure without interfering with each other. Maza and Castagna [1] showed how the route plans of such agents can be repaired by maintaining the priority of agents on infrastructure resources. They also developed an algorithm that allows agents to change priorities to avoid long waits. We extend the work of Maza and Castagna by (i) specifying an algorithm that allows more priority changes, and by (ii) defining a graph structure that can predict exactly which priority changes will lead to a deadlock, and which will not.  2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

Material logistic simulation control technology based on dynamic path planning	2009	Xitong Fangzhen Xuebao / Journal of System Simulation	Logistic simulation control technology based on dynamic path planning was proposed to solve the problem of inconsistency between traditional static path and flexible material logistic net in work-shop. Through decomposition of logistic procedure, logistic simulation control logics which were triggered by action sensors planted in actions as loading, transportation and downloading was constructed. Logistic schedule control was realized by the usage of track and part selection rules. Based on the computation of intercross points of tracks, shortest path was computed using Dijkstra algorithm. Logistic simulation control based on dynamic path planning was realized by adding path planning algorithm into dynamic sensors.

Deadlock-free multi-attribute dispatching method for AGV systems	2009	International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology	This paper aims at developing a flexible, efficient, and deadlock-free dispatching method for automated guided vehicle systems. For this purpose, a deadlock-free multi-attribute dispatching method with dynamically adjustable weights (AWMA) is proposed. Traveling distance, input, and output buffer statuses are selected as dispatching attributes according to the efficiency and deadlock avoidance requirement. The weight for each attribute is dynamically adjusted according to the processing load and transportation load of the system. To ensure the system to be deadlock-free, a deadlock avoidance policy based on remaining capacity concept is introduced. It works by temporarily forbidding critical tasks according to the system state, which will otherwise cause system deadlock. The AWMA method is formed by integrating the deadlock avoidance policy into the multi-attribute dispatching procedure. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, several simulation experiments were carried out to compare three commonly used dispatching methods with the proposed one under different system settings. The simulation results indicate that the deadlock avoidance policy can guarantee the system to be deadlock-free and that the proposed method is efficient.  2009 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

Two types of extended RSNBs and their application in modeling flexible manufacturing systems	2009	International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology	In the former paper (Liu, et al. Int J Adv Manuf Technol 41:66-74, 2009), a novel policy was proposed to prevent deadlocks in a class of flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs). This policy is based on the notion that each shared buffer is partitioned for storing different types of parts. Furthermore, A subclass of Petri nets, resource-shared net with buffers (RSNB), was defined to characterize this policy and model the controlled system. Two extensions of RSNB are defined in this paper. The first extension, which is called extended resource-shared net with buffers (ERSNB), permits the resources to be shared among different stages in one manufacturing process. The second extension, which is called resource-shared assembly net with buffers (RSANB), takes the assembly and choice operations into account. Both ERSNB and RSANB have a well property that each minimal siphon is exactly a minimal trap. It has been proven that an ERSNB or RSANB is live if and only if each minimal siphon is marked under the initial marking. Two well-known examples of FMSs are used to illustrate the proposed concepts and policy.  2009 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

Fidelity of using scaled vehicles for chassis dynamic studies	2009	Vehicle System Dynamics	There are many situations where physical testing of a vehicle or vehicle controller is necessary, yet use of a full-size vehicle is not practical. Some situations include implementation testing of novel actuation strategies, analysing the behaviour of chassis feedback control under system faults, or near-unstable situations such as limit handling under driver-assist feedback control. Historically, many have advocated the use of scale vehicles as surrogates for larger vehicles. This article presents analysis and experimental testing that examines the fidelity of using scaled vehicles for vehicle chassis dynamics and control studies. In support of this effort, this work introduces an experimental system called the Pennsylvania State University Rolling Roadway Simulator (the PURRS). In the PURRS, a custom-built scale-sized vehicle is freely driven on a moving roadway surface. While others have used scale-vehicle rolling roadway simulators in the past, this work is the first to attempt to directly match the planar dynamic performance of the scale-sized vehicle to a specific full-sized vehicle by careful design of the scale vehicle. This article explains details of this effort including vehicle dynamic modelling, detailed measurement of model parameters, conditions for dynamic similitude, validation of the resulting experimental vehicle in the time, frequency, and dimensionless domains. The results of the dynamic comparisons between scale- and full-sized vehicles clearly illustrate operational regimes where agreement is quite good, and other regimes where agreement is quite poor. Both are useful to understand the applicability of scale-vehicle results to full-size vehicle analysis.

An immune inspired algorithm for solving dynamic vehicle dispatching problem in a port container terminal	2009	Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)	A typical Vehicle Dispatching Problem (VDP) for a port container terminal often involves offline resource allocation and is often successfully solved by heuristics algorithms. In this research, an autonomous and decentralized vehicle dispatching algorithm is proposed in which the algorithm is inspired by the human immune system. Specifically, the proposed algorithm is inspired by the cell-mediate immune response of T-cells that possess the capability of exploring the environment and providing an adaptive and specific immune response to the invading antigens. We conduct extensive simulation studies to study the performance of the algorithm in solving a typical vehicle dispatch problem derived from realistic terminal configurations and operational constraints. The results show good vehicle utilization and low computational cost when comparing with a GA-based algorithm.  2009 Springer.

AGV parking system based on tracking landmark	2009	2009 6th International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology, ECTI-CON 2009	This paper presents an efficient method that locates the automated guided vehicle (AGV) into a specific position using vision-based system. For an automated transshipment system in the container terminal, it is necessary for the AGV to recognize the current position of the transfer crane, so that the port AGV locates itself into the working area of the crane. Using an artificially designed landmark attached on the crane, the vehicle detects and tracks the position of the landmark from the video stream through CCD camera fixed to the vehicle. The AGV calculates its position from the position of landmark in the image and control the velocity to align with the crane. The detection method is based on the local features of the landmark such as edges, corners, and color information. After detecting the landmark the vehicle tracks the trace of the target using Condensation algorithm and refinement stage. Detecting and tracking steps are performed in HSI color space to reduce the effect of illumination. Experiment shows reasonable results. 2009 IEEE.

Moving robot's mind of autonomous decentralized FMS and mind change control	2009	Artificial Life and Robotics	This article describes the control of moving robots in an autonomous decentralized flexible manufacturing system (FMS) by changing the mind of the moving robot. In an autonomous decentralized flexible manufacturing system where a lot of moving robots operate, there are problems of path interference. There is an existing method which we have developed called AAA, and this is used to evade these interference problems. However, using this method, it is very difficult to grasp entirely the innumerable path interference situations that really occur. Therefore, to evade these unexpected situations flexibly, we propose a mind model, which is the complicated expression of combinations of three elements: stimulation vector, unit, and load. Even if a familiar situation happens, moving robots can make different actions when their mind is changed.  International Symposium on Artificial Life and Robotics (ISAROB). 2009.

Multi-attribute dispatching method with deadlock avoidance for AGV systems	2009	Zhongguo Jixie Gongcheng/China Mechanical Engineering	To improve the efficiency of AGV systems, a deadlock-free multi-attribute dispatching method with dynamic adjustable weights (AWMA) was proposed. Distance, input and output buffer status were selected as dispatching attributes according to the efficiency and deadlock avoidance requirements. The weight for each attribute was determined depending on the processing and transportation loads of the system. To guarantee deadlock free, a deadlock avoidance policy based on remaining capacity was integrated into the dispatching procedure. To validate the effectiveness of method proposed, simulation experiments were conducted to compare three commonly used dispatching methods with the proposed AWMA method. The simulation results show that the deadlock avoidance policy guarantees the system to be deadlock-free and the AWMA method is better than other methods when resources are scarce. This indicates that the proposed method is effective.

Simple blocking prevention for bay type path-based automated material handling systems	2009	International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology	This paper proposes a simple blocking prevention method for a path-based automated material handling system (AMHS) such as a semiconductor fabrication line. Here, blocking means the situation in which a vehicle stands and waits without doing anything because the vehicle in front of it is in the process of loading or unloading. Since a typical bay type path-based AMHS has a single path in each bay and no sidetracks, the blocking issue is inevitable in a large complex system with many vehicles. The proposed method is based on the swapping of load assignments between retrieval vehicles on the same path. Our simulation study on an example semiconductor line shows that the proposed method improves the AMHS productivity under various vehicle dispatching rules.  2008 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

Integrating production and transportation scheduling in a two-stage supply chain considering order assignment	2009	International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology	This study is concerned with the integration of production and transportation scheduling in a two-stage supply chain environment while considering the assignment of orders to the suppliers. The first stage contains m suppliers distributed in various geographic zones, and the second stage is composed of l vehicles with different speeds and transportation capacities that transport n jobs from the supplier to a manufacturing company. In addition, it is assumed that each job occupies a different vehicle size and could be processed by some permissible suppliers. After modeling the problem as a mixed integer programming problem, a genetic algorithm named dynamic genetic algorithm (DGA) is proposed to solve it. Since this problem has not been mentioned in the literature, DGA performance was evaluated by comparing its outputs with optimum solutions for small-sized problems and to the random search approach for larger problems. Additionally, the performance of the DGA was compared with that of a similar problem from the literature. The results of these comparisons show that the DGA is an excellent approach. In addition, the impact of grouping technology initialization is examined, showing that the quality of the solution was not improved and that there was an increase in the CPU time.  2009 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

Agent-based distributed manufacturing control: A state-of-the-art survey	2009	Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence	Manufacturing has faced significant changes during the last years, namely the move from a local economy towards a global and competitive economy, with markets demanding for highly customized products of high quality at lower costs, and with short life cycles. In this environment, manufacturing enterprises, to remain competitive, must respond closely to customer demands by improving their flexibility and agility, while maintaining their productivity and quality. Dynamic response to emergence is becoming a key issue in manufacturing field because traditional manufacturing control systems are built upon rigid control architectures, which cannot respond efficiently and effectively to dynamic change. In these circumstances, the current challenge is to develop manufacturing control systems that exhibit intelligence, robustness and adaptation to the environment changes and disturbances. The introduction of multi-agent systems and holonic manufacturing systems paradigms addresses these requirements, bringing the advantages of modularity, decentralization, autonomy, scalability and re-usability. This paper surveys the literature in manufacturing control systems using distributed artificial intelligence techniques, namely multi-agent systems and holonic manufacturing systems principles. The paper also discusses the reasons for the weak adoption of these approaches by industry and points out the challenges and research opportunities for the future.  2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Consistent triangulation for mobile robot localization using discontinuous angular measurements	2009	Robotics and Autonomous Systems	Localization is a fundamental operation for the navigation of mobile robots. The standard localization algorithms fuse external measurements of the environment with the odometric evolution of the robot pose to obtain its optimal estimation. In this work, we present a different approach to determine the pose using angular measurements discontinuously obtained in time. The presented method is based on an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) with a state-vector composed of the external angular measurements. This algorithm keeps track of the angles between actual measurements from robot odometric information. This continuous angular estimation allows the consistent use of the triangulation methods to determine the robot pose at any time during its motion. The article reports experimental results that show the localization accuracy obtained by means of the presented approach. These results are compared to the ones obtained applying the EKF algorithm with the standard pose state-vector. For the experiments, an omnidirectional robotic platform with omnidirectional wheels is used.  2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An efficient algorithm for the shortest path problem with forbidden paths	2009	Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)	In this paper, we discuss the shortest path problem with forbidden paths (SPPFP), where the constraints come from a set of forbidden paths (arc sequences) that cannot be part of any feasible solution. SPPFP can be used to solve the problems with hard-to-modeled path constraints or to implement exact branching scheme.The method proposed by Villeneuve and Desaulniers first transfer the SPPFP problem to the k-shortest paths problem. We propose an algorithm which reduces execution time of solving the SPPFP problem via a nodes combination process. It improves the approach proposed by Villeneuve and Desaulniers. In addition, their algorithm for generating augmented paths could cause the inconsistency in particular situations. The proposed method also improves the weakness without increasing its time complexity.  2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

In addition, considering discreteness and uncertainty of single sensor in detecting trace information, sensor array is adopted for information fusion to achieve accurate tracking.

Scheduling and routing of amos in an intelligent transport system	2009	IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems	Autonomous moving objects (AMOs), such as automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and autonomous robots, have widely been used in the industry for decades. In an intelligent transport system with a great number of AMOs involved, it is important to eliminate potential congestion and deadlocks among AMOs to maintain a well-organized traffic flow. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that adapts bitonic merge sort algorithm for concurrent scheduling and routing of a great number (i.e., 4n2) of AMOs on an n Ã— n mesh topology of path network without congestion or deadlocks among AMOs during their moves. The results are tested by experiments with randomly generated data and the comparison of a related model.  2006 IEEE.

Path tracking of agricultural vehicle based on machine vision	2009	Nongye Jixie Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery	An autonomous navigation system based on machine vision for agricultural vehicle was studied. A novel line detection algorithm was proposed for navigation directrix detection, which could decrease the cost of memory and time considerably. A 2-D fuzzy controller with the inputs of lateral error and heading error was built to determine the expected angle of turning wheel, and a turning controller based on PID was constructed to control the turning of front wheel. The simplified kinematics model of two-wheel vehicle was adopted for simulation. The results of simulation and experiments indicated that the navigation system could track the desired beeline path effectively. The maximum tracking lateral error was less than 5 cm and 8 cm at the speed of 0.3 m/s and 0.6 m/s respectively, and the average lateral error was less than 2 cm and 4 cm respectively.

Models and algorithms for multi-crane oriented scheduling method in container terminals	2009	Transport Policy	"Multi-crane oriented" is a scheduling method that yard trailers can be shared by different quay cranes. In this paper, two models for this problem are developed. The first one is a model for an inter-ship-based sharing method. In this model, yard trailers can be shared by quay cranes of different ships. To solve the model, a two-phase Tabu search algorithm is designed. The second one is a model for a ship-based sharing method. In this model, yard trailers can only be shared by quay cranes of the same ship. Q-learning algorithm is designed to solve the model. Numerical tests show that the "multi-crane oriented" method can decrease the yard trailers' travel distance, reduce the disequilibrium of different working lines, and thus improve the operation efficiency in container terminals.

The proposed architecture consists of three autonomous agents (Global Manager Agent, Design Agent, and Optimization Agent) capable of communicating to each other through eXtensible Markup Language (XML). In contrast to the traditional process planning model, a new paradigm incorporating fixture cost has been conceptualized. Optimization agent is facilitated by the virtues of DNA computing and identifies the optimal/near optimal process plan with the help of available resources.

A synchronization approach to trajectory tracking of multiple mobile robots while maintaining time-varying formations	2009	IEEE Transactions on Robotics	In this paper, we present a synchronization approach to trajectory tracking of multiple mobile robots while maintaining time-varying formations. The main idea is to control each robot to track its desired trajectory while synchronizing its motion with those of other robots to keep relative kinematics relationships, as required by the formation. First, we pose the formation-control problem as a synchronization control problem and identify the synchronization control goal according to the formation requirement. The formation error is measured by the position synchronization error, which is defined based on the established robot network. Second, we develop a synchronous controller for each robot's translation to guarantee that both position and synchronization errors approach zero asymptotically. The rotary controller is also designed to ensure that the robot is always oriented toward its desired position. Both translational and rotary controls are supported by a centralized high-level planer for task monitoring and robot global localization. Finally, we perform simulations and experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed synchronization control approach in the formation control tasks.  2009 IEEE.

High-tech cart control system: New automated guided carts at a major carbonated-beverage producer cost half of typical automated guided vehicles and yield major benefits	2009	Control Engineering	New automatic guided carts (AGCs) with advanced-automation features are having a major impact at a new distribution center built by a major carbonated-beverages producer in the southeastern part of the U.S. The AGCs consist of a standard burden-carrier base with an adaptable top to which different load-handling devices, such as roller decks or lifting forks, can be added. Controls from Beckhoff Automation LLC have allowed AIM to integrate intelligence into the vehicle. The AIM system improves quality, reliability, and efficiency by automating the repetitive and labor-intensive order-building process, which virtually eliminates human picking errors.

Development and simulation analysis of real-time yard crane control systems for seaport container transshipment terminals	2009	OR Spectrum	As more and more container terminals open up all over the world, terminal operators are discovering that they must increase quay crane work rates to remain competitive. In this paper, we develop a real-time yard crane control system and show that a terminal's long-run average quay crane rate depends on the portion of this system that dispatches yard cranes in the storage area in real time. Several real-time yard crane dispatching systems are evaluated by a fully-integrated, discrete event simulation model of a pure transshipment terminal that is designed to reproduce the multi-objective, stochastic, real-time environment at an RTGC-based, multiple-berth facility. Results indicate that yard cranes should prioritize the retrieval of containers from the stacks, rather than the storage of containers into stacks. Also, the yard crane dispatching system should not only consider the trucks already waiting for service in the yard, but also the trucks that are heading towards the yard. The experiments provide the first direct connection in the literature between real-time yard crane control systems and long-run performance at a seaport container terminal. We also make a qualitative comparison between rule-based and look-ahead yard crane dispatching schemes, and discuss deadlocking issues in detail.  Springer-Verlag 2008.

Navigation line detection arithmetic based on image rotation and projection	2009	Nongye Jixie Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery	A new tractor navigation line detection arithmetic, named rotation and projection arithmetic, was put forward. At first, the image ROI rotates a series of given angles and for each rotation the ROI's column average values were computed. And then the column average values and the enumeration angles compose the rotation and projection matrix R. Through all row vectors difference operation in R the difference rotation and projection matrix Rd was attained by whose extremum values the image navigation line parameters can be found out (including heading angle and lateral position). Finally the world coordinate guidance line parameters were attained by those parameters. By using the same principle the field end line can also be detected. In order to make the arithmetic more efficient, there are four measures to be used: setting appropriate ROI, utilizing linear reducing, starting as rough-divisiory rotation angle and then elaborate-divisiory rotation angle, using the former frame information. Those measures make one frame processing time in 6.2ms or so. Using various mature wheat images testing indicates that the precision rate of recognizing navigation line is up to 95%.

Design of dynamic petri recurrent fuzzy neural network and its application to path-tracking control of nonholonomic mobile robot	2009	IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics	This paper focuses on the design of a dynamic Petri recurrent fuzzy neural network (DPRFNN), and this network structure is applied to the path-tracking control of a nonholonomic mobile robot for verifying its validity. In the DPRFNN, the concept of a Petri net and the recurrent frame of internal-feedback loops are incorporated into a traditional FNN to alleviate the computation burden of parameter learning and to enhance the dynamic mapping of network ability. Moreover, the supervised gradient-descent method is used to develop the online-training algorithm for the DPRFNN control. In order to guarantee the convergence of path-tracking errors, analytical methods based on a discrete-type Lyapunov function are proposed to determine varied learning rates for DPRFNN. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed DPRFNN control scheme under different moving paths is verified by experimental results, and its superiority is indicated in comparison with FNN, RFNN, Petri FNN, and PRFNN control systems.  2009 IEEE.

An effective algorithm to find elementary siphons in a class of petri nets	2009	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Part A:Systems and Humans	As a structural object of Petri nets, siphons play a key role in the development of deadlock prevention policies for resource allocation systems. Elementary siphons are a novel concept in net theory. Based on graph theory, this paper proposes an effective algorithm with polynomial complexity to find a set of elementary siphons for a linear system of simple sequential processes with resources (LS3PR), a subclass of Petri nets, which can model many flexible manufacturing systems. The algorithm is established through the use of a resource directed graph and complementary sets of strict minimal siphons (SMS) of the net. The upper bound of the number of SMS in such a net is identified. A running example is used to demonstrate the proposed method.  2009 IEEE.

Evaluation of automated guided vehicle systems for container terminals using multi agent based simulation	2009	Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)	Due to globalization and the growth of international trade, many container terminals are trying to improve performance in order to keep up with demand. One technology that has been proposed is the use of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) in the handling of containers within terminals. Recently, a new generation of AGVs has been developed which makes use of cassettes that can be detached from the AGV. We have developed an agent-based simulator for evaluating the cassette-based system and comparing it to a more traditional AGV system. In addition, a number of different configurations of container terminal equipment, e.g., number of AGVs and cassettes, have been studied in order to find the most efficient configuration. The simulation results suggest that there are configurations in which the cassette-based system is more cost efficient than a traditional AGV system, as well as confirming that multi agent based simulation is a promising approach to this type of applications.

Path iterative learning of inertial guided AGV with magnets correction	2009	Nongye Jixie Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery	Pairs of magnets were installed in the path at certain interval and were detected by a magnetic ruler to correct accumulation error of position and orientation of inertial guided AGV. It was difficult to get the absolute position of magnets because of obstacles in job shop and this often caused trouble in debugging AGV. A teach-in method was used to record the position of magnets, and iterative learning control was introduced to update the aim point of AGV. After several times' learning, AGV can run through magnets accurately. This method is easy to use in AGV path tracking. Accumulation of error can be eliminated when correction is done. The results of experiments in a tricycle AGV tugger were given to demonstrate the efficiency.

Intelligent predictive control based on state analysis of visual field for robot path tracking	2009	Jiqiren/Robot	An intelligent predictive control model based on state analysis of visual field is presented for path tracking of the automated guided vehicle (AGV) with vision navigation. An optimal conversion strategy of error states is used to replace the quadratic cost function and to describe the objective of predictive control, so difficulties in parameter selection of pure algebra optimizing methods can be avoided. A synchronous control approach is proposed to completely eliminate two path errors of the ideal rectification state and to keep an error-free tracking state eventually. For other states, an iterative algorithm with assumption-prediction-adjustment is used to realize a harmonious state conversion. Numerical simulations and tests demonstrate that a realizable speed difference output can always be generated to eliminate two path errors synchronously, quickly and smoothly at different error states and velocities. Furthermore, with its low computational complexity, the proposed algorithm can satisfy the demand from realtime processing of embedded control systems.

Synchronization of yard truck scheduling and storage allocation in container terminals	2009	Engineering Optimization	Yard truck scheduling and storage allocation, as two separate subproblems in port operations, have been extensively studied in the past decades. However, from the operational point of view, they are highly interdependent. This article proposes an integer programming model in which yard truck scheduling and storage allocation problems are formulated as a whole for heterogeneous import containers. Different stacking times at yard blocks is modelled as well. The objective of the proposed model is to reduce the congestion and waiting time of yard trucks in the terminal so as to decrease the makespan of discharging containers. Owing to the inherent computational complexity, a genetic algorithm and a greedy heuristic algorithm have been designed. Computational experiments show that the proposed genetic algorithm and greedy algorithm are both effective in solving the studied problem.

The heuristic dispatching method of automatic material handling system in 300mm semiconductor fabrication	2009	International Journal of Innovative Computing, Information and Control	Highly automated materials handling in 300mm semiconductor manufacturing is one of the biggest concerns to practitioners. Based on designs of the single rail, single movement way, and long time while overhead hoist transport (OHT) loading and unloading, the OHT traffic jams are happened frequently. This will cause the OHT traffic jam seriously, and influence so much to the product cycle time. Observing the empirical operations for carrying lots and considering the effect and limitations from OHT transportation, this study proposes a heuristic OHT dispatching rule to expedite the movement of lots for reducing job waiting times. The objective is to minimize the transport delay of lots handling service under the automatic material handling environment in 300mm wafer manufacturing. Numerical experiment results demonstrate that the heuristic dispatching method can effectively expedite the movements for lots delivery. The proposed method is very useful for shop floor control functions, such like scheduling and dispatching, in the 300mm fab-wide automated production environment.  2009 ISSN.

Analyzing the behaviors of virtual cells (VCs) and traditional manufacturing systems: Ant colony optimization (ACO)-based metamodels	2009	Computers and Operations Research	The aim of this paper is two fold. First we investigate the three different types of systems, namely cellular layout (CL), process layout (PL) and virtual cells (VCs). VCs are addressed by using family-based scheduling rule, developed by a part allocation algorithm in a PL. Simulation is used to compare three types of systems under the performance metrics such as mean flow time and mean tardiness. Results indicate that VCs have better responsiveness in terms of the performance metrics. Second we develop a new ant colony optimization-based metamodels fed by existing simulation runs to represent the prospective simulation runs, which require a lot of time and effort. Regression metamodels, which allow us to obtain much faster results, are seen to be promising to estimate the systems behaviors.  2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Time for a shift in crop production: Embracing complexity through diversity at all levels	2009	Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture	A radical shift in our approach to crop production is needed to ensure food security and to address the problems of soil degradation, loss of biodiversity, polluted and restricted water supplies, coupled with a future of fossil fuel limitations and increasingly variable climatic conditions. An interdisciplinary network of European scientists put forward visions for future crop production embracing the complexity of our socio-ecological system by applying the principle of diversity at all levels from soil micro-organisms to plant varieties and cropping systems. This approach, integrated with careful deployment of our finite global resources and implementation of appropriate sustainable technology, appears to be the only way to ensure the scale of system resilience needed to cope with many of our concerns. We discuss some of the most important tools such as (i) building soil fertility by recycling of nutrients and sustainable use of other natural and physical resources, (ii) enhancing biological diversity by breeding of crops resilient to climate change and (iii) reconnecting all stakeholders in crop production. Finally, we emphasise some of the changes in agricultural and environmental regulation and policy needed in order to implement the visions.  2009 Society of Chemical Industry.

Conflict-free scheduling and routing of automated guided vehicles in mesh topologies	2009	Robotics and Autonomous Systems	Many storing and manufacturing systems tend to use automated guided vehicles (AGV) for speed, quality and safety as transporting objects. In this paper an integrated algorithm for scheduling and routing of AGVs in mesh-like systems is presented. The main characteristics of the scheduling algorithm are as follows: (1) prediction and prevention of conflicts, (2) arbitrary choice for AGVs to traverse shortest path from source to destination, (3) effect of priority policies to the scheduling result, and (4) no theoretical limitation on the number of participated AGVs. The proposed greedy algorithm for routing reduces the average number of conflicts and is closely related to the scheduling algorithm. We will also present mathematical and statistical models for the analysis of the algorithms.  2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

How to get multi-agent systems accepted in industry?	2009	International Journal of Agent-Oriented Software Engineering	With many researchers in the Multi-Agent System (MAS) community, we share the opinion that too much of the quality and relevant research in the area of MAS is underrepresented in the development of complex distributed systems in practice today. In our experience, a Babylonic mismatch is a crucial factor in this fact - research on MAS profiles itself as an isolated community and, as such, may create artificial thresholds to convince mainstream software developers of its merits. We argue that integrating the concepts and techniques from agent-based software engineering within mainstream software engineering provides opportunities to amplify the industrial adoption of MAS. To ground this position, we discuss MAS engineering from the perspective of the software engineering area that we are most familiar with: software architecture.

A mathematical approach for variable speed convoy movement problem(CMP)	2009	Defense and Security Analysis	The movement of defense establishments in a convoy can be explained using a mathematical model. During wartime or emergency situations, convoys move non-stop to their destinations except for minor routine halts for food and rest.

An integrated simulation-optimization framework for the operational planning of seaport container terminals	2009	Mathematical and Computer Modelling of Dynamical Systems	In this article the operational planning of seaport container terminals is considered by defining a suitable integrated framework in which simulation and optimization interact. The proposed tool is a simulation environment (implemented by using the Arena software) representing the dynamics of a container terminal. When the system faces some particular conditions (critical events), an optimization procedure integrated in the simulation tool is called. This means that the simulation is paused, an optimization problem is solved and the relative solution is an input for the simulation environment where some system parameters are modified (generally, the handling rates of some resources are changed). For this reason, in the present article we consider two modelling and planning levels about container terminals. The simulation framework, based on an appropriate discrete-event model, represents the dynamic behaviour of the terminal, thus it needs to be quite detailed and it is used as an operational planning tool. On the other hand, the optimization approach is devised in order to define some system parameters such as the resource handling rates; in this sense, it can be considered as a tool for tactical planning. The optimization procedure is based on an aggregate representation of the terminal where the dynamics is modelled by means of discrete-time equations.  2009 Taylor & Francis.

Second order sliding mode control of vehicles with distributed collision avoidance capabilities	2009	Mechatronics	Recent research has shown that the longitudinal control of platoons of vehicles is appropriate to improve the traffic capacity of road networks while maintaining the safety distance between vehicles. This paper investigates the possibility of reducing the number of accidents involving pedestrians or other vulnerable road users (VRUs), like cyclists and motorcyclists, by providing the control systems of the vehicles of the platoon with some collision detection and avoidance capabilities. The control system proposed in this paper allows to maintain a desired distance from the preceeding vehicle, and, as a novelty with respect to other proposals, to avoid the collision with VRUs present on the road. The proposed control scheme is realized by means of a supervisor, which makes the decision on which is the appropriate current control mode for each controlled vehicle, and manages the switches among low-level controllers. The adopted control technique is the so-called sliding mode control methodology, which is particularly suitable to deal with the uncertainties and disturbances typical of automotive applications.  2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Supervisor localization: A top-down approach to distributed control of discrete-event systems	2009	AIP Conference Proceedings	A purely distributed control paradigm is proposed for discrete-event systems (DES). In contrast to control by one or more external supervisors distributed control aims to design built-in strategies for individual agents. First a distributed optimal nonblocking control problem is formulated. To solve it a top-down localization procedure is developed which systematically decomposes an external supervisor into local controllers while preserving optimality and nonblockingness. An efficient localization algorithm is provided to carry out the computation and an automated guided vehicles (AGV) example presented for illustration. Finally the easiest' and 'hardest' boundary cases of localization are discussed.  2009 American Institute of Physics.

Effect of block length and yard crane deployment systems on overall performance at a seaport container transshipment terminal	2009	Computers and Operations Research	As more and more container terminals open up all over the world, terminal operators are discovering that they must increase quay crane work rates in order to remain competitive. In this paper we present a simulation study that shows how a terminal's long-run average quay crane rate depends on (1) the length of the storage blocks in the terminal's container yard and (2) the system that deploys yard cranes among blocks in the same zone. Several different block lengths and yard crane deployment systems are evaluated by a fully dynamic, discrete event simulation model that considers the detailed movement of individual containers passing through a vessel-to-vessel transshipment terminal over a several week period. Experiments consider four container terminal scenarios that are designed to reproduce the multi-objective, stochastic, real-time environment at a multiple-berth facility. Results indicate that a block length between 56 and 72 (20-ft) slots yields the highest quay crane work rate, and that a yard crane deployment system that restricts crane movement yields a higher quay crane work rate than a system that allows greater yard crane mobility. Interestingly, a block length of 56-72 slots is somewhat longer than the average block in use today. The experiments provide the first direct connection in the literature between block length and long-run performance at a seaport container terminal. The simulator can be suitably customized to real, pure-transshipment ports and adequately tuned to get an appreciable prescriptive power.  2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The modes of communication interchanges with the supported human include spoken speech and gestures (including eye gaze direction) within the context of situational analysis which accommodates recent history, temporal factors and individual user behavioural models. This paper provides an overview of an ambitious research project in its early stages but where many components have already been refined through earlier work.  2009 IEEE.

Navigation using environmental constraints	2009	2009 6th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference, CCNC 2009	Location and mobility management are critical issues for the growing worldwide market in location based services (LBS). Existing research generally requires either special hardware to measure time (thus the distance) and angle or manually constructing database maps using one or a combination of techniques such as lateration, triangulation, database mapping or dead reckoning. In contrast, pathways that uniquely exploit sharing spaces among collaborating objects for the purpose of navigation are far less studied. This paper first analyzes the FreeMobility, a simpler but effective location determination technique, that exploits wireless communications abilities under a broad environmental context; then detailed comparison with database mapping based methods is conducted using measurement data from both GSM and Wi-Fi networks. Results indicate that the adoption of environmental constraints will transform wireless localization research from straightforward hardware dominated approaches to a more independent system approach and thus it opens a new window of opportunity valuable to the research community. 2009 IEEE.

Kinetic maintenance of mobile k-centres on trees	2009	Discrete Applied Mathematics	Given a set P of points (clients) on a weighted tree T, a k-centre of P corresponds to a set of k points (facilities) on T such that the maximum graph distance between any client and its nearest facility is minimised. We consider the mobilek -centre problem on trees. Let C denote a set of n mobile clients, each of which follows a continuous trajectory on a weighted tree T. We establish tight bounds on the maximum relative velocity of the 1-centre and 2-centre of C. When each client in C moves with linear motion along a path on T, the motions of the corresponding 1-centre and 2-centre are piecewise linear; we derive a tight combinatorial bound of Î˜ (n) on the complexity of the motion of the 1-centre and corresponding bounds of O (n2 Î± (n)) and Î© (n2) for a 2-centre, where Î± (n) denotes the inverse Ackermann function. We describe efficient algorithms for calculating the trajectories of the 1-centre and 2-centre of C: the 1-centre can be found in optimal time O (n log n) and a 2-centre can be found in time O (n2 log n). These algorithms lend themselves to implementation within the framework of kinetic data structures. Finally, we examine properties of the mobile 1-centre on graphs and describe an optimal unit-velocity 2-approximation. Crown Copyright  2008.

A new memetic algorithm for optimizing the partitioning problem of tandem AGV systems	2009	International Journal of Production Economics	In tandem automated guided vehicle (AGV) systems, all the work stations (processing centers) are partitioned into non-overlapping zones, where each zone is served by a dedicated vehicle. Beside the system input/output stations, additional pickup/drop-off (P/D) points are installed to link these zones as transfer points. In this paper, a new memetic algorithm (MA) is proposed to optimize the partitioning problem of tandem AGV systems. MAs are hybrid evolutionary algorithms (EAs) that combine the global and local search by using a genetic algorithm (GA) to perform exploration and a local search method to perform exploitation. Hence, a local search method has been designed and combined with a GA to refine the individuals of the population (i.e. improve their fitness). The objective is to minimize the maximum AGVs' workload in order to balance the workload among all the zones and hence avoid the presence of bottlenecks. The MA performance is evaluated by comparing the obtained results with the reported results in the literature as well as the pure GA. Furthermore, some newly designed test cases are proposed and solved using both, MA and GA. The results show that, overall, the developed MA outperforms both pure GA and the other reported methods in the literature. Crown Copyright  2009.

A dispatching method for automated lifting vehicles in automated port container terminals	2009	Computers and Industrial Engineering	In automated container terminals, containers are transported from the marshalling yard to a ship and vice versa by automated vehicles. The automated vehicle type studied in this paper is an automated lifting vehicle (ALV) that is capable of lifting a container from the ground by itself. This study discusses how to dispatch ALVs by utilizing information about pickup and delivery locations and time in future delivery tasks. A mixed-integer programming model is provided for assigning optimal delivery tasks to ALVs. A procedure for converting buffer constraints into time window constraints and a heuristic algorithm for overcoming the excessive computational time required for solving the mathematical model are suggested. Numerical experiments are reported to compare the objective values and computational times by a heuristic algorithm with those by an optimizing method and to analyze the effects of dual cycle operation, number of ALVs, and buffer capacity on the performance of ALVs.  2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Optimal path tracking control based on motion prediction	2009	Kongzhi yu Juece/Control and Decision	An optimal control of linear quadratic regulator (LQR) based on motion prediction is presented for path tracking of an automated guided vehicle. The optimal harmony among multistep control is achieved by motion prediction in a global view under velocity constraints. A selection of weighted matrix is avoided when a objective function includes only one item of speed difference output. The high effectivity of the algorithm to correct errors is ensured by minimization of control steps. The results of numerical simulations and tests on an actual AGV both demonstrate that a realizable optimal control sequence is obtained to eliminate two path errors synchronously, quickly and smoothly on different conditions of path errors and velocities. Furthermore, this algorithm can well satisfy the demand on realtime rolling optimization for an embedded control system owing to its low computational complexity.

Euler method based route choosing strategy for the vehicles in container yard	2009	Dongbei Daxue Xuebao/Journal of Northeastern University	Discusses the model or strategy developed by Ye et al for improving the production efficiency via container yard where only few narrow paths are provided for the lots of vehicles. Then, the Euler method is introduced into the path-resource-orientated study on the control and decision-making of vehicles' route choosing in a container yard. In this study whether a path is unimpeded or not can be predicted spatially and temporally for vehicles which will therefore travel along a path that is unimpeded and comparatively shorter. Testing results showed that the congestion time and total operational time will both be clearly shortened if the route is chosen according to the proposed strategy in comparison to that developed by Ye et al.

Quantity of material handling equipment-A queuing theory based approach	2009	Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing	In this paper, we discuss the development of a two step analytical approach to determine the quantity of material handling equipment (MHE) required for effective handling of products among facilities. In the first step, a preliminary solution is obtained by considering the time required for loading and unloading of products, loaded travelling, empty travelling and breakdown of MHE. A detailed model, which integrates both operational and cost performance factors such as utilisation of MHE, work-in-process at the MHS and life-cycle cost, is then utilised to rank alternatives that are generated from the preliminary solution. The stochastic nature of a manufacturing system, which is not adequately addressed in the literature, is best modelled using queuing theory. An illustrative problem is given, and it is shown that for all the considered problems our approach outperforms the existing methods. The influence of various other factors including the operational characteristics of processing facilities, layout design, maintenance function, MHE speed and batch size in selection of the quantity of MHE is also demonstrated. Thus we show the significance of our proposed approach and its capability to support an integrated decision making process.  2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Evolutionary techniques for optimization problems in integrated manufacturing system: State-of-the-art-survey	2009	Computers and Industrial Engineering	Integrated manufacturing system (IMS) is a novel manufacturing environment which has been developed for the next generation of manufacturing and processing technologies. It consists of engineering design, process planning, manufacturing, quality management, and storage and retrieval functions. Improving the decision quality in those fields give rise to complex combinatorial optimization problems, unfortunately, most of them fall into the class of NP-hard problems. Find a satisfactory solution in an acceptable time play important roles. Evolutionary techniques (ET) have turned out to be potent methods to solve such kind of optimization problems. How to adapt evolutionary technique to the IMS is very challenging but frustrating. Many efforts have been made in order to give an efficient implementation of ET to optimize the specific problems in IMS. In this paper, we address four crucial issues in IMS, including design, planning, manufacturing, and distribution. Furthermore, some hot topics in these issues are selected to demonstrate the efficiency of ET's application, such as layout design (LD) problem, flexible job-shop scheduling problem (fJSP), multistage process planning (MPP) problem, and advanced planning and scheduling (APS) problem. First, we formulate a generalized mathematic models for all those problems; several evolutionary algorithms which adapt to the problems have been proposed; some test instances based on the practical problems demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach.  2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Study on magnetic navigation for nurse assistant robot	2009	Yi Qi Yi Biao Xue Bao/Chinese Journal of Scientific Instrument	A magnetic sensing system used in the nurse assistant robot navigation is introduced.The nurse assistant robot is driven by DC motors and turned around by wheel system.As immovable marker, the NdFeB magnetic markers are embedded into the ground of the scheduled paths of the robot to form the navigation line. The magnetic rulers detecting the magnetic markers are consisted of 8 magnetoresistive sensors which are fastened straightly on a plexiglas plate. The deviation angle between the actual and planning paths of the robot is obtained by measuring the relative locality of the magnetic rulers and the navigation line, which is used to modify the move direction of the robot. The experimental result indicates that the navigation method is easy to be realized and make the robot track of the magnetic marker navigation line precisely.

A genetic algorithm for scheduling flexible manufacturing cells	2009	Journal of Applied Sciences	In this study, scheduling of Flexible Manufacturing Cells (EMC) is taken into consideration. This type of production system combines the merit of job shop and flow shop production systems. FMS Scheduling belongs to the class of problems that are known as NP-hard. This study presents a genetic algorithm-based technique to schedule machines and Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV), simultaneously. To generate schedules from a given chromosome, four Priority Dispatching Rules (PDR) are considered. Maximum completion time or makespan is defined as the objective function. The algorithm was coded and many randomly generated problems were solved. The obtained results were compared with optimum values obtained from the most comprehensive mathematical formulation in the literature. The experimental results show that the proposed method performs well in terms of efficiency and quality of solutions. For further study, the researchers will consider this problem in multi-objective environment.  2009 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

Hybrid genetic algorithm for designing logistics network, VRP and AGV problems	2009	Studies in Computational Intelligence	The use of hybrid genetic algorithm (Hybrid GA) in the networks design has been growing the last decades due to the fact that many practical networks design problems are NP hard. This paper examines recent developments in the field of evolutionary optimization for network design. We combine the various hybrid genetic algorithms to a wide range of practical network problems such as a logistics network model, VRP (Vehicle Routing Problem), and AGV (Automated Guided Vehicles) dispatching problem. It is covered as follows: first, we apply the hybrid priority-based GA for solving fixed-charge Transportation Problem (fcTP), which the proposed approach is more effective in larger size than benchmark test problems. Second, we give the several resent GA approach for solving Multistage Logistic Network Problem. Third, we introduce Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and variants of VRP. We apply the priGA for solving Multi-depot vehicle routing problem with time windows (mdVRP-tw). Lastly, we apply a priority-based based GA to solve an automated guided vehicles (AGV) dispatching problem in Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS).  2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Adoption of control policies in a simulative model for the design of AGV systems	2009	Spring Simulation Multiconference 2009 - Co-located with the 2009 SISO Spring Simulation Interoperability Workshop	Nowadays, industrial applications are showing an increasing interest toward the adoption of automated logistic handling systems, such as systems including Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs). A logistic handling system represents the physical link between the production system (i.e. parallel production lines) and the shipment system (i.e. fleets of vehicles for goods delivery). The synchronization between these two processes is an important issue, especially for companies producing final goods and giving priority to direct shipments rather than to store products inside the plant. Nevertheless, the variability in the generation of production patterns and shipment arrivals may lead to an unacceptable loss of synchronization. In order to prevent this harmful situation, some control policies can be adopted: it could be necessary to review shortterm plans acting on production patterns and/or on shipment priority. This paper deals with the design and management of a logistic handling system including AGVs by using a simulation model. Normally, the objective of the design phase is the identification of the optimal number of AGVs to include in the system. For this purpose, an effective simulative model has to consider what happens both in the upstream (i.e. production system) and in the downstream(i.e. shipment system) of the logistic system. Nevertheless, the modeling of a real complex system has also to include the control policies that assure the necessary synchronization between the production and shipment processes. A methodological approach is then proposed and an application to a design problem derived form an actual case study is presented and discussed.

Smart deadlock prevention policy for flexible manufacturing systems using Petri nets	2009	IET Control Theory and Applications	Deadlocks are a highly undesired situation in automated production systems including flexible manufacturing systems. Based on a Petri net formalism, a novel deadlock prevention policy is proposed for a class of Petri nets, S 3PR, by using an MIP-based deadlock detection method and elementary siphons of Petri nets. Deadlock prevention is achieved by synthesising a set of monitors that are added to the plant net model. The concept of dominated transitions is proposed, to which the output arcs of the monitors are led. The monitors are computed according to a set of elementary siphons in a plant net model, which is found by using an established algorithm in the literature. When compared with the existing policies, the proposed method leads to a liveness-enforcing Petri net supervisor with a small number of monitors but more permissive behaviour. Examples are used to demonstrate the proposed method.  2009 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

Modeling and monitoring of E-commerce workflows	2009	Information Sciences	Electronic commerce (E-commerce) is an important Internet application that is significantly changing the way of commercial transaction. Due to the complexity of E-commerce systems and lack of well-designed formal models, providing a suitable method for their modeling and monitoring turns out to be a challenging job. This paper introduces labeled workflow nets (LWN) and their semantics on the basis of labeled Petri nets. Then an inter-organizational labeled workflow net (ILWN) - which can graphically model the dynamic behavior of the systems - is presented. Furthermore, the nonblocking property of ILWNs is defined to achieve a common goal of E-commerce participants. This nonblocking property helps to analyze the soundness of ILWNs and the undeniable property of interactive actions. The proposed framework for E-commerce workflows (ECW) can record a history of interactive events and monitor the execution of interactive activities to achieve a common goal. Therefore, it can elegantly model the execution of interorganizational workflows and analyze the accountability of cooperative activities. The main contribution of the paper is to present a new formal mechanism - ILWN. It can efficiently support the modeling and monitoring of ECWs. Finally, this paper illustrates how to use the proposed method by modeling and analyzing a Customer-Producer-Supplier example.  2008 Elsevier Inc.

Vehicle scheduling in 2D shop floor environments	2009	Industrial Robot	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop an efficient method for solving a vehicle scheduling problem (VSP) in 2D industrial environments. An autonomous vehicle is requested to serve a set of work centers in the shop floor providing transport and delivery tasks while avoiding collisions with obstacles during its travel. The objective is to find a minimum in length, collision-free vehicle routing schedule that serves timely as many as possible work centers in the shop floor. Design/methodology/approach - First, the vehicle's environment is mapped into a 2D B-Spline surface embedded in 3D Euclidean space using a robust geometric model. Then, a modified genetic algorithm is applied on the generated surface to search for an optimum legal route schedule that satisfies the requirements of the vehicle's mission. Findings - Simulation experiments show that the method is robust enough and can determine in a reasonable computation time a solution to VSP under consideration. Originality/value - There is a gap in the literature for methods that face VSP in shop-floor environments. This paper contributes to filling this gap by implementing a practical method that can be easily programmed and included in a modern service delivery system.  2009 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Scheduling of AGVs and machines in FMS with makespan criteria using sheep flock heredity algorithm	2009	International Journal of Physical Sciences	This paper addresses the problem of simultaneous scheduling of machines and two identical automated guided vehicles (AGVs) in a flexible manufacturing system (FMS) so as to minimize makespan and mean tardiness. For solving this problem, a sheep flock heredity algorithm is proposed. An increase in the performance of the FMS under consideration would be expected as a result of making the scheduling of AGVs an integral part of the overall scheduling activity. For this particular problem, coding has been developed, which gives optimum sequence with makespan value and AGV'S schedule for ten job sets and four layouts. Most of the time, results of sheep flock algorithm are better than other algorithm and traditional methods.  2009 Academic Journals.

An new approach for the automatic analysis and control of material handling systems: Integrated layout flow analysis (ILFA)	2009	International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology	In the majority of small and medium sized enterprises (SEMs), the direct costs of material handling cannot be clearly measured. There are several reasons for this, including the large number of product types, complexity of their production cycle, and continuous change in markets. Therefore, production managers require flexible tools to create a suitable material handling system model which explicitly and rapidly calculates the indices required as these are traditionally neglected or laboriously approximated, (i.e., time and cost in material flow inside the factory, storage area requirements, and MH utilization percentage). This paper proposes an integrated approach to analyzing and controlling material handling operations in an industrial manufacturing plant from a "full quantitative" point of view. The model presented unites quite different fields of research into a unique methodology. This material handling model rapidly and automatically provides production managers with extensive and significant information. As a result, integrated layout flow analysis interrelates systematic layout planning with operational research algorithms and visual interactive simulation, using a complete software platform to implement them. This integrated layout flow analysis approach focuses on determining the space requirement for manufacturing department buffers, the transportation system requirements, the performance indices, and the time and cost of material flows spent in the layout and in MH traffic jams.  2008 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

Management of logistics operations in intermodal terminals by using dynamic modelling and nonlinear programming	2009	Maritime Economics and Logistics	The increase in efficiency of container terminals is addressed via an approach based on the optimisation of logistics operations. Toward this end, a discrete-time dynamic model of the various flows of containers that are inter-modally routed from arriving carriers to carriers ready for departure is proposed. On the basis of such a model, the decisions on the allocation of the available handling resources inside a container terminal are made according to the predictive-control approach by minimising a performance cost function over a forward horizon from the current time instant. Since both the dynamic equations and the cost function are in general nonlinear and since binary variables are used to model the departure or stay of a carrier, such decisions result from the on-line solution of a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem at each time step. To solve this problem, two techniques are proposed that have to deal explicitly with the binary variables and with the nonlinearities of the model and the cost function. The first relies on the application of a standard branch-and-bound algorithm. The second is based on the idea of treating the decisions associated with the binary variables as step functions. Simulation results are reported to illustrate the pros and cons of such methodologies in a case study.  2009 Palgrave Macmillan.

Modal split evaluation of a maritime container terminal	2009	Maritime Economics and Logistics	Maritime container terminals are playing a growing role within global transport chains. As intermodal nodes between sea traffic flows and inland distribution, they are very important to shipping lines. The current trend of moving towards economies of scale in regard to mother vessels is also having a tremendous impact on seaport operations and hinterland transportation in terms of call size. This paper deals with the study of multimodal container flows at an Italian maritime terminal, focusing the attention on the performance of road and rail connections. In this framework, the current modal unbalance generates heavy problems of congestion and compromises the overall terminal competitiveness. This paper applies a discrete event simulation approach, in order to evaluate the feasibility of an alternative and more balanced scenario achievable in a short-mid-term perspective. Our goal is to enhance the performance of rail connections, without proposing the realisation of a new railway line which is only attainable in the long run, but trying to exploit to the full the available endowment of assets through a deep operational restructuring. Simulation runs performed in this perspective revealed the adequacy of such an approach and demonstrated the successful effects of a modal re-equilibrium.  2009 Palgrave Macmillan.

Simulation-based optimization of dispatching rules for semiconductor wafer fabrication system scheduling by the response surface methodology	2009	International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology	Scheduling of a semiconductor wafer fabrication system (SWFS) is complicated due to its re-entrant product flow, high uncertainties in operations, and rapidly changing products and technologies; thus dispatching rules have been widely used for real-time scheduling because they can provide a very quick and pretty good solution. However, deciding how to select appropriate rules is very difficult and seldom tackled. This paper describes an approach into the evaluation and optimization of dispatching rules by integrating the simulation and response surface methodology (RSM). In order to implement the proposed approach, a dynamic bottleneck dispatching (DBD) policy is designed, in which bottlenecks are detected in a timely way and adaptive dispatching decisions are made according to the real-time conditions. In addition, two case studies are carried out to demonstrate the approach. One case compares DBD to regular rules, such as CR + FIFO, EDD, SRPT, SPT, SPNB and Justice, a bottleneck dispatching method. Simulation results show that the DBD policy is superior to the other six methods. In another case study, the parameters of DBD are optimized by RSM and desirability function, and the result proves that the optimized DBD method can get even better performance.  2008 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

A divide-and-conquer strategy to deadlock prevention in flexible manufacturing systems	2009	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics Part C: Applications and Reviews	Petri nets are a popular mathematical tool to investigate the deadlock problems in resource allocation systems. As an important problem solution paradigm in computer science, the divide-and-conquer strategy is used in this paper to investigate the deadlock prevention for flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs) that are modeled with Petri nets. Based on the concept of resource circuits, a plant net model is divided into an idle subnet, an autonomous subnet, and a number of small but independent subnets, called toparchies, from the viewpoint of deadlock control. A liveness-enforcing supervisor, called toparch, is designed for each toparchy. If a particular separation condition holds in a plant net model, the computational complexity of toparches is significantly reduced. This research shows that the resultant net, called monarch, by composing the toparches derived for the toparchies can serve as a liveness-enforcing Petri net supervisor for the whole plant model. FMS examples are given to illustrate the proposed method.  2009 IEEE.

Zone design and control for vehicle collision prevention and load balancing in a zone control AGV system	2009	Computers and Industrial Engineering	Because of their routing flexibility, automated guided vehicles (AGVs) have been used in many manufacturing systems, especially those in which parts with diverse and complex processing routes are made. In recent years, there have been many studies on AGV-related problems. One of them is preventing the collision of vehicles. Some traditional vehicle collision prevention strategies are zone strategies that divide guide paths into several non-overlapping zones and restrict the presence of only one vehicle in any zone at any time. Traditional zone strategies are fixed zone strategies in which the area of a zone is fixed and vehicles are not allowed to help each other. Because of these restrictions, fixed zone strategies cannot always satisfy the system's transportation demand if there is a load imbalance between vehicles of different zones. In this paper, a new zone strategy is proposed for a zone control AGV system with a network guide path. The proposed strategy is a dynamic zone strategy, which is different from a fixed zone strategy. It relies on two methods - zone partition design and dynamic zone control - to prevent the collision of vehicles and to maintain the load balance between the vehicles of different zones. The zone partition design defines a relationship coefficient, which measures both the distance relationship and the flow relationship between workstations, and uses it to find an initial zone partition design. We then improve this initial design by an SA (Simulated Annealing) based improvement procedure to achieve a better load balance result. The dynamic zone control uses two methods - zone repartition and load sharing - to ensure that vehicle collision can be prevented and the system's load balance can be maintained when the system is in operation. Simulation experiments were conducted to understand the performance of the proposed strategy. The simulation results show that the proposed strategy outperform the fixed zone strategy in throughput, WIP inventory, and flow time. The results also show that the proposed strategy is able to adapt to any changes (in the system) that cause the load imbalance problem between zones.  2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Modeling of workflow congestion and optimization of flow routing in a manufacturing/warehouse facility	2009	Management Science	This paper discusses the notion of workflow congestion in the context of material handling equipment interruptions in a manufacturing or warehousing facility. Development of a combination of probabilistic and physics-based models for workflow interruptions permits evaluation of the expected link travel time. The problem is then of routing in a way that minimizes total expected travel time. The rerouting problem is modeled as a multicommodity flow problem with link capacity design. A greedy upper bounding and Lagrangean relaxation algorithm are developed to solve this efficiently. To calibrate our modeling process we develop an object-oriented simulation model that explicitly considers various workflow interruptions. Our major finding is that rerouting traffic in a congested facility can significantly alleviate congestion delays and improve the efficiency of material movement. A managerial insight derived from this work is that rerouting is most effective in medium traffic-intensity situations.  2009 INFORMS.

Advanced technology towards developing decentralized autonomous flexible manufacturing systems	2009	Studies in Computational Intelligence	One of the advanced technology for controlling production systems is a decentralized autonomous Flexible Manufacturing System (DA-FMS). The autonomous decentralized FMS aims at high production efficiency by giving self-control or decentralizing the plan, design and operation of FMS. This paper discusses the intelligent real-time decision making necessary for realizing an autonomous decentralized FMS with Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGVs) and Machining Centers (MCs). This research develops a real-time production control method called reasoning to anticipate the future (RAF) based on the predictions that forecast not only current production situations but also anticipate future ones. The paper also describes a method to rank competing hypotheses by oblivion and memory (ranking by oblivion and memory; ROM) for improving the reasoning efficiency of RAF.  2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Estimation and control of Automatic Guided Vehicle	2009	International Journal of Mechatronics and Manufacturing Systems	In this paper a control strategy of Automatic Guided Vehicle (AGV) is proposed. The structure of AGV is described. The strategy is based on two main purposes: the path is stored in the PLC memory and the vehicle displacement is calculated form the wheel rotation measurement. The control and localisation systems are developed. Reference path and observation measurement are matched. To keep track of the matching result of both positions, the estimated position information used to update the vehicle's position by using the Kalman Filtering (KF) algorithm. Test performance is verified with accurate positioning control by simulation and experimentation.  2009 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

A hybrid genetic-heuristic algorithm for scheduling of automated guidedvehicles and quay cranes in automated container terminals	2009	2009 International Conference on Computers and Industrial Engineering, CIE 2009	Containers have been used in past decades increasingly as one of the mostimportant transportation tools. Containers have revolutionized cargo shippingand thus changed the world trade systematically. Container terminals as thetranshipment facility play a valuable role in performance of this transportationsystem. Improvement of this facility has been widely considered in literatures.Automated container terminals (ACTs) have been introduced to pursue thispurpose. In ACTs various transport vehicles are automated and integrated to eachother. Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are used in ACTs to handle containersbetween quay cranes and storage yards. Usually scheduling of the AGVs is knownas the key factor to improve the performance of ACTs. This paper proposed aheuristic algorithm to schedule the AGVs concurrently with quay cranes. Agenetic algorithm is proposed to optimize the simultaneous scheduling of AGVsand QCs. The results showed that proposed genetic algorithm can be used inpractical implications while its running time is reasonably low.  2009IEEE.

A random key-based genetic algorithm for AGV dispatching in FMS	2009	International Journal of Manufacturing Technology and Management	Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) is a mobile robot used highly in industrial applications to move materials from point to point. AGV helps to reduce cost of manufacturing and increases efficiency in a manufacturing system. In this paper, we focus on the dispatching of AGVs in a Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS). A FMS environment requires a flexible and adaptable material handling system. To overcome the complex system constraints of AGV dispatching in FMS, we model an AGV system by using network structure. We also propose an effective evolutionary approach for solving this problem as a network optimisation problem by Random Key-based Genetic Algorithm (RKGA). The objective is minimising the time required to complete all jobs (i.e. makespan). Numerical experiments for case study show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Intelligent automated guided vehicle with reverse strategy: A comparison study	2009	Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)	This paper describes the intelligent automated guided vehicle (AGV) control system. The AGV used in this paper is a virtual vehicle simulated using computer. The purpose of the control system is to control the simulated AGV for moving along the given path towards the goal. Some obstacles can be placed on or near the path to increase the difficulties of the control system. The intelligent AGV should trace the path by avoiding these obstacles. In some situations, it is inevitable to avoid the obstacles without reversing. In this paper, we look into the use of fuzzy automaton for controlling the AGV. In order to better avoid the obstacles, reverse strategy has been implemented to the fuzzy automaton controller. Another alternative to incorporate the human expertise and observations is to use a hybrid intelligent controller using fuzzy and case base reasoning to implement the reverse strategy. This paper presents the comparison results for the three intelligent AGV systems used to avoid obstacles.  2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

A zones formation algorithm for tandem AGV systems	2009	IFAC Proceedings Volumes (IFAC-PapersOnline)	This article presents a zone formation algorithm for tandem AGV systems. The goal of the algorithm is to partition a given layout into a set of non overlapping zones in order to minimize the part flows between zones (or inter-zone part flows). The proposed algorithm is based on the principle of clustering. At the start of the algorithm, we allocate each station to a zone. Later, we merge zones at various runs of the algorithm to form new zones using inter-zone parts flow and distance criteria. The restriction on the size and the parts flow in the zones is obtained by comparison against user-defined values. The algorithm terminates when all the zones satisfy the desired size and parts flow limits. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach using a numerical illustration.  2009 IFAC.

The performance of load-selection rules and pickup-dispatching rules for multiple-load AGVs	2009	Journal of Manufacturing Systems	In this paper, we address the problem of load selection and pickup-dispatching of multiple-load AGVs. Various load-selection rules and pickup-dispatching rules are proposed and studied. The objective of this study is twofold. We want to understand not only the performance of load-selection rules and pickup-dispatching rules in two performance criteria-throughput and tardiness, but also the effects that pickup-dispatching rules and load-selection rules have on each other's performance. The simulation results indicate the load-selection rule with a selection criterion based on the destination similarity between loads has the best throughput and tardiness performance. Also, the pickup-dispatching rule that dispatches vehicles to the workstation with the greatest queue length has the best throughput and tardiness performance. The simulation results also indicate load-selection rules and pickup-dispatching rules affect each other's performance. For example, a load-selection rule's throughput and tardiness performance tends to improve if it is paired with a pickup-dispatching rule that shares similar logic. Furthermore, not all average-time-value-based pickup-dispatching rules are better (in throughput or tardiness) than their respective single-time-value-based pickup-dispatching rules under all load-selection rules.  2009 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

Effective overhead hoist transport dispatching based on the Hungarian algorithm for a large semiconductor FAB	2009	International Journal of Production Research	This paper considers the vehicle dispatching problem in large-scale overhead hoist transport (OHT) systems of semiconductor fabrication lines. We propose a Hungarian algorithm based OHT reassignment approach named HABOR. HABOR attempts to take advantage of simultaneous vehicle reassignment based on up-to-date system status using the formulation of the assignment problem. The effectiveness of HABOR is demonstrated using a sample OHT system of a semiconductor fabrication line with more than 130 vehicles, where the flow path of the line allows direct delivery so that an inter-bay wafer movement can be accomplished by a single vehicle without an intermediate storage step at a stocker. HABOR compares favorably with the shortest travel distance first rule and with the reassignment-based rule recently proposed by the authors.

Semi-autonomous vehicles with routing flexibility - Functionality and application areas	2009	International Journal of Services and Operations Management	Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) systems are standard automated items in production and warehousing today. However, studies have rarely examined a more advanced form of AGVs called Semi-Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs), which have a higher sophistication of task completion and routing flexibility. This research presents SAVs in an industrial development case study. Using simulation, the route-keeping ability of SAVs with two types of guidance techniques is being studied. The results show that dual-navigation SAVs can provide the needed flexibility for routing. Using wire guidance and dead reckoning, both very well-established techniques, the SAVs' performance is, within certain limits, quite comparable to the AGVs with more advanced and expensive navigation techniques.

Real time estimation of Supersonic Projectile roll angle using magnetometers: In-lab experimental validation	2009	IFAC Proceedings Volumes (IFAC-PapersOnline)	The goal of ISL's project GSP (Guided Supersonic Projectile) is to change the flight path of an air-defence projectile in order to correct the aim error due to the target manoeuvres. The originality of the concept is based on pyrotechnical actuators and onboard sensors which control the angular motion of the projectile. First of all, the control of the actuators requires the precise control of the roll angle of the projectile. To estimate the roll angle of the projectile, two magnetometers are embedded in the projectile to measure the projection of the earth magnetic field along radials axes of the projectiles. Then, an extended Kalman filter is used to compute the roll angle estimation. As the rolling frequency of the GSP is about 22 Hz, it is easy to test the navigation algorithm in laboratory. Two magnetometers and a LED are rotated using an electrical engine; then an electronic station based on a DSP runs an extended Kalman filter and runs a guidance algorithm to compute the trigger times of the LED. By using a high speed camera, we can observe and improve the accuracy of the method.  2009 IFAC.

Logic-algebraic method based and constraints programming driven approach to AGVs scheduling	2009	International Journal of Intelligent Information and Database Systems	The subject matter of the study is the automated guided vehicle (AGV) operation synchronisation mechanisms in flexible manufacturing systems. The processes examination has to guarantee the collision-free and deadlock-free AGVs flow. The problem of determination of the rules coordinating access of the vehicles to the shared travel route intervals, ensuring the collision-free and deadlock-free execution of the repetitive processes was reduced to determination of the sufficient conditions of the form of a pair (initial state, a set of priority rules). In particular the problem of searching for a pair is defined in the form of the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) and is solved with use of the logic programming techniques. The inference engine applied in the LAM is then easily implemented in a kind of constraint logic programming language. Proposed approach provides the framework allowing one to take into account both distinct, and imprecise data, in a unified way. Copyright  2009, Inderscience Publishers.

Evaluaton of dispagtching strategies in the decentralized coordination of AGVS	2009	16th ITS World Congress	Due to a steady increase in container traffic worldwide, modern Container Terminal ports are turning towards automation to raise their productivity, capacity and reliability. Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are among the most commonly used solutions for horizontal transport within a container terminal. A more recent development in the automated container handling is the use of cassette based or C-AGVs. The latest generation of which provides a zero emission, all electric solution through the use of induction recharge points in the terminal area. The Multi-Agent System (MAS) based simulation model provides a method for evaluating dispatching strategies for this newest generation of C-AGVs. The location and number of recharge points, cassettes, yard and quay cranes as well as the paths containers have to travel are all included in the model. The NetLogo based simulator will be used to compare existing dispatching strategies, modified versions of them, or develop and test new ones. The simulator will also simulate different scenarios, which are described in the later sections, and can thus be used to determine the best configuration and investment plan in a highly complex domain like a Container Terminal.

ROPTALMU - A new concept of crawling portable robotic system for wing spars drilling	2009	SAE Technical Papers	In this paper a new concept of portable-crawler robotic system for wing spars drilling during their assembly phase will be presented. The solution developed, named ROPTALMU, consists of a drilling robot that is brought along the shop floor to the wing assembly tooling by means of an automated guided vehicle (AGV). Once in front of the tooling, the drilling robot is detached from the AGV and fixed securely and accurately to the tooling structure. Then a first set of holes is drilled inside the robot's reach. After this, in order to work in another product's working zone, the robot is able to walk automatically along the tooling. Once the work finished in the whole product, the robot is put again in the AGV and brought to the next product tooling. The system has been conceived so that it is able to adapt to a wide variety (different families) of wing spars performing drilling tasks on materials such as aluminum, CF and titanium. This way ROPTALMU constitutes a portable and affordable system that provides great flexibility in terms of aeronautic production. Copyright  2009 SAE International.

Optimal location of dwell points in a single loop AGV system with time restrictions on vehicle availability	2009	European Journal of Operational Research	Since the workload of a manufacturing system changes over time, the material handling equipment used in the facility will be idle at certain time intervals to avoid system overload. In this context, a relevant control problem in operating an automated guided vehicle (AGV) system is where to locate idle vehicles. These locations, called dwell points, establish the response times for AVG requests. In this article, a dynamic programming algorithm to solve idle vehicle positioning problems in unidirectional single loop systems is developed to minimize the maximum response time considering restrictions on vehicle time available to travel and load/unload requests. This polynomial time algorithm finds optimal dwell points when all requests from a given pick-up station are handled by a single AGV. The proposed algorithm is used to study the change in maximum response time as a function of the number of vehicles in the system.  2007.

An integrated approach to determine the block layout, AGV flow path and the location of pick-up/delivery points in single-loop systems	2009	International Journal of Production Research	Layout design and material handling system design are two of the major aspects of facility planning. Although both aspects directly influence each other, the classical approach to the layout design is carried out in two separate steps: in the first step the block layout, i.e. the location of the departments in the workshop, is constructed, and in the second step, the material handling system is designed. The separate optimisation of these two aspects of the problem leads to solutions that can be far from the global optimum. In this paper, we develop an integrated algorithm to design the facilities and material handling systems. We focus on single-loop AGV systems. The proposed algorithm determines the block layout, AGV single-loop flow path and pick-up delivery stations, simultaneously. The associated from-to chart and the area of departments are the principal inputs of the algorithm. The objective is minimising total material flow distance among all departments. The results of our computational experiments show the algorithm was coded using MATLAB 7.0, and that our integrated algorithm is more efficient in terms of both the objective function value and the runtime.

Dynamic routing strategies for automated container terminals	2009	ESM 2009 - 2009 European Simulation and Modelling Conference: Modelling and Simulation 2009	Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) play a central role in automated container terminals. To achieve a high productivity of the terminal it is necessary to develop efficient routing methods. This paper studies dynamic routing methods for AGV systems. Dynamic AGV routing offers great advantages over the traditional static routing methods. It can add flexibility, reduce congestion and eliminates deadlock. In this research, a shortest path planning using time windows (SPPTW) concept is used to find the possible alternative routes for each AGV. The optimal route is selected based on the shortest travel time. Two alternatives are compared in this paper. In the first method presented, the entire route between origin and destination is determined before the AGV starts driving. On large, complex terminals, thus with a large number of nodes, this approach can lead to unacceptable long calculations. To reduce the computation time of the algorithm, a second method is proposed which adds a decision point in the middle of the entire route. The purpose of this decision point is to present a more dynamic situation, where AGVs are allowed to stop during route execution. The decision point can be configured as a parking location on the terminal, not blocking the other traffic, or as a recharging point in real terminal operation.

The transport strategies for fully automated manufacturing in 300 mm wafer fab	2009	International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing	This paper addresses the operational issues of transport strategies in tool and vehicle dispatching integration (TVDI) architecture in a fully automated manufacturing wafer fab. At present, there are three transport strategies involved in vehicle dispatching, namely, avoid blocking, avoid starvation, and accelerate batch preparation. These strategies were developed to obviate production obstacles and to avoid capacity loss. Consequently, there are five levels in the decision-making process of TVDI, namely, dispatching request, conditions checking, candidate selection, dispatching rules, and result execution. Specifically, candidate selection was classified into five categories: FOUP-selects-tool (FST), FOUP-selects-stocker (FSS), tool-selects-FOUP (TSF), FOUP-selects-vehicle (FSV), and vehicle-selects-FOUP (VSF). The proposed transport strategies were implemented in VSF, and a simulation model abstracted from a wafer fab in Taiwan was used to evaluate the performance. The results show that the differences in the proposed strategies compared with ignoring the issues are statistically significant, and the performances of the wafer output, cycle time and waiting time can be improved.  2009 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Context-aware multi-stage routing	2009	Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, AAMAS	In context-aware route planning, a set of agents has to plan routes on a common infrastructure and each agent has to plan a conflict-free route from a source to a destination with-out invalidating plans made by other agents. The existence of such a conflict-free set of plans can be ensured if each agent is allowed to reserve time slots on the infrastructure resources it intends to use. In the multi-stage variant of the context-aware routing problem, each agent has a sequence of destination locations it must visit. A naive approach to solve the multi-stage variant is to make context-aware route plans between every two subsequent locations in the sequence, and then to concatenate these plans together. It can easily be shown, however, that this concatenation approach cannot guarantee that a multi-stage plan (if it exists) can always be found, and even if it is found, then it need not be optimal. Therefore, we present a new polynomial-time algorithm for the multi-stage routing problem that always returns the optimal (shortest-time) route for a single agent, given a set of reservations made by previous agents, thus providing a set of Pareto-optimal route plans. Obviously, the need for such a dedicated multi-stage routing algorithm depends on the frequency with which the concatenation approach fails to find a plan, or finds a rather inefficient one. Our experiments show that, given a set of reservations from 200 agents, the concatenation approach fails to find a solution in more than 50% of the eases, for random visiting sequences of six locations or more. However, if the concatenation approach does find a solution, its plan quality is often close to that of an optimal solution.

Decomposition of petri nets and lagrangian relaxation for solving routing problems for AGVs	2009	International Journal of Production Research	In this paper, we propose a Lagrangian relaxation method for solving routing problems for multiple AGVs by decomposition of timed Petri nets. The AGV routing problem is represented by an optimal transition firing sequence problem for timed Petri nets. The timed Petri net is decomposed into several subnets in which the subproblem for each subnet can be easily solved by Dijkstra's algorithm. We show that each subproblem generated by each subnet is polynomially solvable. The optimality of the solution can be evaluated by the duality gap derived by the Lagrangian relaxation method. The performance of the proposed method is compared with a conventional optimisation algorithm with the penalty function method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated.

RADIO frequency indoors localization using trilateration	2009	16th Saint Petersburg International Conference on Integrated Navigation Systems, ICINS 2009 - Proceedings	This paper describes state-of-art radio frequency (RF) localization in indoors quasi-structured environments. Trilateration is a technique adopted by RF localization method which makes use of available communications subsystem. Therefore, localization hardware is supported by that sub-system and only additional software is shown to be necessary in building localization framework. This paper shows that RF localization can be applied to indoors localization of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) with improvement of localization accuracy using artificial neural networks (ANNs). ANN can be a type of transfer function emulation scheme that does not require knowledge of corresponding function properties and, with a feed-forward structure trained through error back-propagation algorithms, it can be useful to estimate AGV location through RF link signal parameter measurements.

Modelling the effect of AGV operating conditions on operator perception of acceptability and hazard	2009	International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing	In order to increase productivity and reduce labour costs, many manufacturing companies have adopted automated systems such as automated guided vehicles (AGVs) for performing material handling and transportation tasks in the production process. In the study, virtual reality is utilised to simulate the pre-defined path of AGVs, and examine the effects of operating conditions on perception of hazards in virtual and real operating conditions. A series of experiments were conducted to develop an empirical relationship with the psychophysical Stevens' power law. Based on the analytical results from the experiments, empirical models of Stevens' psychophysical power functions for perception of acceptability and hazards within a dynamic virtual work environment are developed. Using the sequential experiments technique, a comparison of perception in virtual and real operating conditions was made for female subjects (n=20) after data bridging. Results show that speed of the AGV and distance to the AGV significantly influence the perception of hazards in virtual operating conditions.

The decentralised control in AD-FMS enables to solve dynamically some typical task of production system without using a fixed centralised control system. We adopt a hypothetical reasoning approach that will decide the conceivable next action from the competition hypothesis. Simulation results show that the efficiency of AGV in AD-FMS increased.  2009 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The generalised dwell point location problem	2009	International Journal of Industrial and Systems Engineering	This research presents a generalised procedure to determine the optimal dwell point location for an arbitrary service device within a defined region. Similar to some existing dwell point location research for material handling systems, this study models a generic system that responds to demands for service from a region defined by a bi-variate random vector over some predefined service region as well as from a particular point analogous to the Input/Output (I/O) location for an arbitrary material handling system. A step-by-step procedure is delineated for determining the optimal dwell point location for a generic system. Extensions to the model for systems with multiple point (I/O) locations as well as for systems with multiple service regions are also presented. Copyright  2009, Inderscience Publishers.

Real-time AGV action decision in AD-FMS by hypothetical reasoning	2009	European Journal of Scientific Research	In this study we present an approach of hypothetical reasoning for action decision of Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) in Autonomous Decentralized in Flexible Manufacturing Systems (AD-FMS). The AD-FMS is characterized as being online, in real- time mode and of a short-term nature that responds to frequent changing of the production order. The decentralized control in AD-FMS enables to solve dynamically some typical task of production system without using a fixed centralized control system. We adopt a hypothetical reasoning approach that will decide the conceivable next action from the competition hypothesis. Simulation results show that the efficiency of AGV in AD-FMS increased.

Dynamic deployment rule of transfer cranes in container terminal	2009	2008 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics, ROBIO 2008	In a container terminal, the workload distribution among storage blocks (container stacking areas) changes over time. Therefore, transfer cranes (TCs), which are mobile cranes for container handling in storage blocks, have to move among blocks appropriately according to the distribution, and, the efficiency of yard operations depends heavily on the productivity of TCs. In the proposed method, we calculate the distribution by looking ahead to determine the deployment of TCs dynamically. The simulation results show that the proposed method can improve the efficiency of yard operations.  2008 IEEE.

Closed form models for dwell point locations for overhead bridge cranes	2009	International Journal of Operational Research	This research presents a methodology for determining the optimal dwell point location for an overhead bridge crane to minimise the expected response times. The problem is modelled as a planar minisum location problem with both zero dimensional (point) and two-dimensional (planar) existing demands. These demands come in three forms: from the Input/Output (I/O) location into the service area (storage move), from the service area to the I/O (retrieval move); and, across the service area (intra-service area move). The result is a non-trivial solution to where the crane should dwell when it is idle. Results of an implementation are also presented.  2009 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Route planning method of multiple mobile robots for transportation task based on collision prospect	2009	Nihon Kikai Gakkai Ronbunshu, C Hen/Transactions of the Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers, Part C	Multiple robot system with decentralized control attracts attention and is expected to play an important role in transportation systems in factories and warehouses. In transportation systems, it is necessary to plan a route that minimizes the transportation time with less collision and deadlock. The goal of this study is to calculate appropriate routes with reducing communication load and computational load. In this paper, we proposed to combine prior route planning and local avoidance. In order to reduce computational load, each robot predict probability of collision with other robots by comparing present and destination position. A route with less collision is calculated by reflecting the overlap of route which has probability of collision into dijkstra method. The proposed method is evaluated through the computer simulation and the experiment using real robots.

Three dimensional ultrasound gestural interface	2009	Proceedings - IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium	Tracking complex human body 3D gestures to realize human-computer interfaces is possible using the proposed localization system. It is composed of a number of low-cost 3D remote position sensors and of a set of beacons that emit a sequence of ultra-acoustic pulses in the space region containing the position sensors. When impinged by the acoustic wavefronts, each sensor sends back a signal to a central unit through a suitable transmission channel. The central unit, knowing the positions of the acoustic beacons and the time of arrival of the sensor signals, computes the positions of the sensors, identifying and discarding possible false signals due to echoes and environmental noise. In a first prototype implementation, four coplanar beacons, actually earphones, are placed at the corners of a PC screen, and are forced to emit pulses in the 20 - 40 kHz band. Each sensor is equipped with a wideband miniature microphone, which is wired to an acquisition board. All the computation, including signal filtering, time of arrival detection, localization and results display, is carried out by a notebook PC at 25 Hz. 2009 IEEE.

Analysis of algorithms for an online version of the convoy movement problem	2009	Journal of the Operational Research Society	In the convoy movement problem (CMP), a set of convoys must be routed from specified origins to destinations in a transportation network, represented by an undirected graph. Two convoys may not cross each other on the same edge while travelling in opposing directions, a restriction referred to as blocking. However, convoys are permitted to follow each other on the same edge, with a specified headway separating them, but no overtaking is permitted. Further, the convoys to be routed are distinguished based on their length. Particle convoys have zero length and are permitted to traverse an edge simultaneously, whereas convoys with non-zero length have to follow each other, observing a headway. The objective is to minimize the total time taken by convoys to travel from their origins to their destinations, given the travel constraints on the edges. We consider an online version of the CMP where convoy demands arise dynamically over time. For the special case of particle convoys, we present an algorithm that has a competitive ratio of 3 in the worst case and (5/2) on average. For the particle convoy problem, we also present an alternate, randomized algorithm that provides a competitive ratio of (âˆš 13-1). We then extend the results to the case of convoys with length, which leads to an algorithm with an O(TCL) competitive ratio, where T={Maxet(e)}/{Minet(e)}, C is the maximum congestion (the number of distinct convoy origin-destination pairs that use any edge e) and L={MaxcL(c)}/{MincL(c)}; here L(c)>0 represents the time-headway to be observed by any convoy that follows c and t(e) represents the travel time for a convoy c on edge e.  2009 Operational Research Society Ltd.

Integrated, virtual plant design and commissioning methodology using digital manufacturing and lean principles	2009	SAE Technical Papers	New and unprecedented changes in customer demands, globalization, cost pressures, innovative product development strategies to shorten product development time, and changing external landscape with reduction of trade barriers, poses challenges and opportunities for the manufacturing industry. Customer demands and needs require modification and reconfiguration of existing manufacturing and assembly plants as well as creation and setup of new 'Greenfield' facilities in developing countries. Currently, the solutions provided by most service providers focuses on limited elements of the solution methodology. We have developed an integrated methodology to perform virtual plant commissioning using digital manufacturing, design for six sigma and lean manufacturing principles. Starting from product definition, the paper goes into the depth of macro and micro level plant layout, line layout and definition, line simulation, line balancing, optimization of line and process plans, tooling station detail, material flow, and kitting of modules. It integrates design at plant level, line level, station level and equipment level and as a result of this approach; multiple what-if scenarios are evaluated and visualized in 3D, early on in the product development process, before the need for investment in plant infrastructure. In addition, this methodology helps simulate the movement of a 3D digital prototype through a virtual plant; thereby helping reduce 'unpredicted' product launch costs and corrective tear-up of physical infrastructure.

New method for ultrasonic absolute localization	2009	Jilin Daxue Xuebao (Gongxueban)/Journal of Jilin University (Engineering and Technology Edition)	The precision of the traditional ultrasonic localization method is limited due to unsufficiently precise estimation of the sound velocity and the time of flight (TOF), therefore, a new method, the special fusion method for redundancy ultrasonic information (SFMRUI) was proposed to solve the precision problem. SFMRUI uses the geometric relationships among the redundant information and the implicit relationships between the redundant information and the error to correct the error It is possible to eliminate the error of TOF, to calculate the wave lagging error and to estimate the measurement accuracy by SFMRUI. The experiments and simulations were performed and their results proved that the SFMRUI is correct and effective to improve the absolute localization accuracy. The proposed method is superior obviously to the traditional method and the time difference method.

Simulation models for evaluation of terminal operations and traffic flow on adjacent road network	2009	IFAC Proceedings Volumes (IFAC-PapersOnline)	The goods movement via terminals at ports is a complex operation as it involves use of different modes of transport that includes surface and marine. In this paper, we present three simulation models which can be used to understand and evaluate these operations. The macroscopic simulation model simulates the flows in and out of terminals and ports and it is integrated with a microscopic simulation model of the adjacent road network. A terminal cost model receives inputs from these two models to evaluate the cost associated with the processing of containers inside the terminal. The use of the three models is demonstrated by evaluating the impact of terrorist attack scenarios on a container terminal in LA/LB Port complex.  2009 IFAC.

Deadlock control of autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems via coloured timed Petri nets and digraph tools	2009	International Journal of Production Research	This paper addresses the deadlock control problem for the autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval system (AVS/RS). For an AVS/RS with several autonomous vehicles running in bi-direction, deadlock control is one of the key issues in the implementation of AVS/RS. The cycle-deadlock is the main type of deadlock in AVS/RS. In the paper, the dynamic model of AVS/RS is investigated by using coloured timed Petri nets (CTPN). Based on the CTPN model, a route digraph is built to detect cycle-deadlock in AVS/RS with digraph tools; the necessary and sufficient conditions of deadlock-free are established. Moreover deadlock-free control policies are proposed, the critical state in deadlock free is also identified and FCFS policy is applied to solve it. Finally, a case study is given to validate the policies.

Development of a self-position recognition method by using image processing and 3D model of a warehouse for automation guided vehicle	2009	Nihon Kikai Gakkai Ronbunshu, C Hen/Transactions of the Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers, Part C	In this paper, we propose a self-position recognition method, which uses image processing and three-dimensional (3D) modeling, for improving the navigation of an automation guided vehicle (AGV) in a warehouse.

Modelling reconfigurable manufacturing systems with coloured timed petri nets	2009	International Journal of Production Research	Reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMSs) have been acknowledged as a promising means of providing manufacturing companies with the required production capacities and capabilities. This is accomplished through reconfiguring system elements over time for a diverse set of individualised products often required in small quantities and with short delivery lead times. Recognising the importance of dynamic modelling and visualisation in decision-making support in RMSs and the limitations of current research, we propose in this paper to model RMSs with Petri net (PN) techniques with focus on the process of reconfiguring system elements while considering constraints and system performance. In view of the modelling challenges, including variety handling, production variation accommodation, machine selection, and constraint satisfaction, we develop a new formalism of coloured timed PNs. In conjunction with coloured tokens and timing in coloured and timed PNs, we also define a reconfiguration mechanism to meet modelling challenges. An application case from an electronics company producing mobile phone vibration motors is presented. Also reported are system analysis and application results, which show how the proposed formalism can be used in the reconfiguration decision making process.

Multistage off-line permutation packet routing on a mesh: An approach with elementary mathematics	2009	Journal of Computer Science and Technology	Various methods have been proposed for off-line permutation packet routing on a mesh. One of the methods is known as multistage routing, in which the first stage is crucial. For the first stage of routing, the previous study normally converts it to a problem of graph theory and proves the existence of solutions. However, there is a lack of simple algorithms to the first stage of routing. This article presents an explicit and simple approach for the first stage of routing based on elementary mathematics.  2009 Springer.

Real time method to detect the waving drive from a single camera	2009	IEEJ Transactions on Electronics, Information and Systems	In this paper, we propose a method to detect the waving drive from a single camera in real-time. The requirement for the proposed method is computation time, accuracy and the dependency on the lane marker. The previous waving drive detection systems are based on the detection of the lane marker. Thus, the previous systems can't work on a road with no lane marker, like a snow road. The proposed method uses the planar region in front of the vehicle by converting it to a top-view image. The system is able to work on a road without a lane marker. To resolve the problem of the computation time, we apply the particle filter to speed up the proposed method. The proposed method is tested on both synthesized and real image to check the accuracy and computation speed. The experiment shows that the proposed method works on both roads with or without lane marker. Also, an online experiment is done to demonstrate that proposed method works in real-time.  2009 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

Optimising material handling costs in an assembly workshop	2009	International Journal of Production Research	The intense competition imposed by the current global market, forces companies to implement lean manufacturing techniques. Major progress has already been made in this field and factories continue to reduce costs and lead times. Within this context, the crucial impact of logistics on production efficiency renders the design and planning of the supply chain a key factor in the reduction of costs and the maximisation of product availability. The logistics of an assembly workshop are usually specified empirically, which often generates an overestimation of its needs. Therefore, the current study focuses on these needs and introduces the ACW (assignment of components in warehouses) method for optimising the assignment of components to storage areas. This original method is based on a successive resolution of cost assessments, shortest path problems and generalised assignment problems. It takes into account congestions in the network of aisles that appear during the loading/unloading stages of material handling. A case study of Renault's Flins factory is detailed to validate the proposed method.

A cooperative control model for multiagent-based material handling systems	2009	Expert Systems with Applications	This paper presents an Artificial Immune System (AIS)-based model for cooperative control of multiagent systems. This cooperative control model describes collective behaviors of autonomous agents, known as the AIS agents that are exemplified by the regulated activities performed by individual agents under the computation paradigm of Artificial Immune System. The regulations and emergence of agent behaviors are derived from the immune threshold measures that determine those activities performed by the AIS agents at an individual level. These threshold measures together with the collective behavioral model defined the cooperative control of the AIS-based control framework under which AIS agents behave and act strategically according to the changing environment. The cooperative control model is presented under the three domains, namely exploration, achievement and cooperation domains where AIS agents operate. In this research, we implemented the proposed cooperative control model with a case study of automated material handling with a group of AIS agents that cooperate to achieve the defined tasks.  2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Short-term schedulability analysis of multiple distiller crude oil operations in refinery with oil residency time constraint	2009	IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics Part C: Applications and Reviews	Because of the complexity of a short-term scheduling problem for crude oil operations, some constraints are ignored in modeling the system by the existing approaches, leading to an infeasible solution. To avoid this, the short-term scheduling problem can be studied in control theory perspective by viewing an operation decision in the schedule as a control. With this idea, this paper conducts the schedulability analysis for systems with two and more than two distillers, and the schedulability conditions are presented with the help of Petri net theory. It shows that the number of charging tanks and their capacity, the amount of crude oil of different types in the charging tanks, the oil transportation rate of the pipeline, and the production rate of the system affect the safeness of the system. It also presents the conditions under which the system can reach its maximal production rate. With the safeness conditions and proved results presented in this paper, if a refining schedule is realizable, a feasible detailed schedule for the refining schedule can be easily obtained by creating the operation decisions for the schedule one by one. In the schedule obtained, the starting time of each operation decision can be at any continuous time point, and the schedule is certainly feasible, which overcomes the difficulty faced by techniques that are based on mathematical programming methods.  2008 IEEE.

Extension of the Honda-DRI "safety impact methodology" (SIM) for the NHTSA advanced crash avoidance technology (ACAT) program and application to a prototype advanced collision mitigation braking system	2009	SAE Technical Papers	The Advanced Crash Avoidance Technologies (ACAT) program initiated by the National Highway Safety Administration had two major objectives. These were to develop a standardized Safety Impact Methodology (SIM) tool to evaluate the effectiveness of advanced technologies in avoiding and mitigating specific types of vehicle crashes; and to develop and demonstrate objective tests that are used in the SIM to verify the safety impact of a real system. Honda and Dynamic Research Inc. (DRI) have been developing and applying such SIMs for several years and have a Cooperative Agreement with NHTSA to further develop a SIM that provides an estimate of full systems safety benefits at a national level. Objective tests that produce quantifiable, repeatable and reproducible results have been developed to ensure that the proposed safety problem countermeasure will meet full system performance specifications and that the results are directly linked to the safety needs and a sample of technology-relevant accidents being addressed. The objective tests, which are based on dynamic reconstructions of a sub-sample of the technology-relevant real accidents, include full-scale track tests with an expert driver using automatically guided soft targets (GSTs) of an automobile and a pedestrian, and driving simulator tests with a jury of typical drivers in order to include the effects of a sample of driver reactions to system warnings and interventions. Results from the objective tests were used to parameterize, calibrate and validate the SIM tool, which was then used to estimate US-level safety benefits. The SIM tool itself includes modules for automated reconstruction of conflict and crash scenarios; definition and sampling of technology-relevant crash types; dynamic simulation involving a human-vehicle-device-environmental model; and an overall safety effects estimator. An example application of the developed SIM tool and related objective tests is used to evaluate a Honda prototype Advanced Collision Mitigation Braking System (A-CMBS).

Two-level manufacturing system performance analyser	2009	International Journal of Production Research	Open queuing network is a commonly used analytical tool for modelling manufacturing systems. Parametric decomposition is a proven solution method for analysing open queuing networks and can estimate key performance measures such as work-in-process inventory, cycle time, and machine utilisation, fairly accurately. This paper presents a two-level hierarchical open queuing network model, which considers numerous features seen in a real manufacturing system including, machine set-up, material handling device setup (for example, loading and unloading operations), process as well as transfer batching, empty travel of the material handling device and machine or material handling device failures. The model first analyses a higher level open queuing network whose nodes are aggregations of a set of machines. The higher level network is solved via the parametric decomposition method and the results are then disaggregated to get lower level, e.g. machine specific, results. The motivation, algorithm and its relationship with the one-level model are discussed. Experimental results are provided to show that the two-level model provides comparable results with the one-level model in addition to its computational and managerial advantages.

Implementing an integrated framework for internal logistics management in automated semiconductor manufacturing	2009	International Journal of Logistics Systems and Management	Nowadays, productivity and ergonomic reasons impose the use of Automated Material Handling Systems (AMHS) to transfer work-in-process within modern semiconductor factories. It is necessary to manage the AMHS to attain high throughput and short cycle times. Traditional simulation-based models considered the AMHS as an isolated system and do not provide formal modelling approaches necessary for its efficient reuse and management. This paper studies the implementation of a global modelling framework for the operational behaviour of wafer factories by using an efficient AMHS control policy.

Linear programming and Lagrangian relaxation heuristics for designing a material flow network on a block layout	2009	International Journal of Production Research	This paper focuses on the problem of designing a material flow network for a given block layout. For an efficient design of a network, we simultaneously consider locations of input and output points, flow paths, and the smoothness of material flow paths. A mixed integer programming formulation is given for the problem with the objective of minimising the sum of transportation cost, cost related to flow paths, and penalty cost for non-smooth flows, i.e., flows with many turns. We suggest two heuristic algorithms based on the linear programming relaxation and the Lagrangian relaxation techniques. To evaluate performance of the suggested algorithms, a series of computational experiments is performed on well-known problem instances as well as randomly generated test problems. Results show that the suggested algorithms give good solutions in a reasonable amount of computation time.

Hedging production schedules against uncertainty in manufacturing environment with a review of robustness and stability research	2009	International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing	Scheduling is a decision-making process that is concerned with the allocation of limited resources to competing tasks (operations of jobs) over a time period with the goal of optimising one or more objectives. In theory, the objective is usually to optimise some classical system performance measures such as makespan, tardiness/earliness and flowtime under deterministic and static assumptions. In practice, however, scheduling systems operate in dynamic and stochastic environments. Hence, there is a need to incorporate both uncertainty and dynamic elements into the scheduling process. In this paper, the major issues involved in scheduling decisions are discussed and the basic approaches to tackle these problems in manufacturing environments are analysed. Proactive scheduling is then focused on and several robustness and stability measures are presented. Previous research on scheduling robustness and stability is also reviewed and further research directions are suggested.

Tightly trapped acoustic phonons in photonic crystal fibres as highly nonlinear artificial Raman oscillators	2009	Nature Physics	Interactions between light and hypersonic waves can be enhanced by tight field confinement, as shown in periodically structured materials 1 , microcavities 2 , micromechanical resonators 3 and photonic crystal fibres 4-6 (PCFs). There are many examples of weak sound-light interactions, for example, guided acoustic-wave Brillouin scattering in conventional optical fibres 7 . This forward-scattering effect results from the interaction of core-guided light with acoustic resonances of the entire fibre cross-section, and is viewed as a noise source in quantum-optics experiments 8 . Here, we report the observation of strongly nonlinear forward scattering of laser light by gigahertz acoustic vibrations, tightly trapped together in the small core of a silica-air PCF. Bouncing to and fro across the core at close to 90Â° to the fibre axis, the acoustic waves form optical-phonon-like modes with a flat dispersion curve and a distinct cutoff frequency Î© a . This ensures automatic phase-matching to the guided optical mode so that, on pumping with a dual-frequency laser source tuned to Î© a , multiple optical side bands are generated, spaced by Î© a . The number of strong side bands in this Raman-like process increases with pump power. The results point to a new class of designable nonlinear optical device with applications in, for example, pulse synthesis, frequency comb generation for telecommunications and fibre laser mode-locking.

The agent environment in multi-agent systems: A middleware perspective	2009	Multiagent and Grid Systems	Interaction is at the core of multi-agent systems. We use agent environment as a general term to denote the medium for agent interaction. Over the last years, the agent environment has been subject of active research. In this paper, we reflect on the role of the agent environment in multi-agent systems from a middleware perspective. Our study yields the following observations: (1) multi-agent system engineers consider distributed middleware (RMI, CORBA, etc.) as the basic platform for developing multi-agent systems, (2) common middleware services (security, persistency, etc.) are only minimally considered in multi-agent systems, (3) domain-specific middleware for multi-agent systems such as communication services and support for stigmergic coordination are typically developed as stand-alone services and as such difficult to compose with other services. From these observations, we derive a number of challenges for research on environments in multi-agent systems: (1) to amplify reuse, application-specific services should be further consolidated into domain-specific services, (2) the problem of integration must be tackled, i.e. horizontal integration among domain-specific services for multi-agent systems, and vertical integration of domain-specific services upwards with the agents, and downwards with the common middleware services and the underlying distributed platform, (3) to support dynamic changing requirements of the system at hand, flexible composition and dynamic adaptation of services must be supported by the agent environment.  2009 - IOS Press and the authors.

Effect of block width and storage yard layout on marine container terminal performance	2009	Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review	Block widths ranging from two to fifteen rows in a marine container terminal are evaluated by a fully-integrated, discrete event simulation model. Experiments consider dozens of yard configurations and four container terminal settings that are designed to reproduce the microscopic, stochastic, real-time environment at a multiple-berth facility. Results show that the quay crane rate is concave with respect to block width when the yard storage capacity and amount of yard equipment is constant. The optimal block width ranges from 6 to 12 rows depending on the amount of equipment deployed and the size, shape, and throughput of the terminal.  2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Mobile robot navigation strategies oriented to goal achievement with local monocular data	2009	Robot Vision: Strategies, Algorithms and Motion Planning	2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.The research presented here integrates control science and robot vision knowledge in a computer science environment. The perception of the navigation environment is based on sensor systems that provide distance measurements in the vicinity of the robot. This essential task can be accomplished by different range systems such as ultrasonic sensors, laser rangefinders and vision-based systems. Among them, the computer vision-based system is one of the most attractive and useful sensing method. It presents some interesting aspects such like its falling down price and capacity of providing richer information than other traditional ranging devices. The monocular techniques considered are Depth from Focus (DFF) and Optical Flow (OF); the methodology presented exploits benefits from both approaches. Moreover odometer system information is locally considered in order to correlate the acquired frames. Among many objectives in the mobile robot navigation, it is very important to achieve the feasible and accurate trajectory planning. The navigation control signals should include the policy of obstacle avoidance, as well as the final desired coordinate achievement. These mobile robot navigation approaches propose the use of potential fields, and the use of model predictive control (MPC) on a short prediction horizon. Real Time MPC control laws are analyzed by considering several constraints. In this work, trajectory tracking is pursued by using real time mobile robot MPC implementations with monocular local vision sensing. This article will be organized as follows. First, it is presented the useful methodologies relevant to the present research work, especially on the mobile robot navigation based on computer vision, monocular 3D machine vision techniques and model-based control strategies. Experimental indoor results obtained with the available lab platform, consisting in a differential-driven robot with a free rotating wheel, are depicted. Then, it is presented the research developed and results obtained on the predictive model-based control by using an occupancy grid framework obtained by monocular perception techniques and odometer system data. Finally, conclusions are drawn and further research works are commented.	Book	b	ch	Chapter	Spain	0	Engineering (all),Computer Science (all)	None
